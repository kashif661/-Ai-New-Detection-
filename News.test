"__label__fake crossfit training the upperclassman
before its news
youve been completing wods consistently youre gradually improving your times youre controlling your diet and youve perfected your technique on most if not all of the exercises commonly encountered in crossfit training
you probably feel great in fact you might feel better than you have in years youve got more energy more stamina and more strength and you probably sleep more soundly than ever
so what now where can you go from here its time to start thinking about competing
preparing for a competition
truthfully nothing can fully prepare you for your first crossfit competition its something you have to experience to understand however its important to have a set of guidelines to keep you focused during the event with so much energy and excitement in the air its easy to get sidetracked and its also easy to blow yourself out too early and lose your intensity
in the days leading up to the event concentrate on hydrating maintaining your diet and any supplements youre using and continuing to train as hard as you can three or four days before the event pull back a bit on your wods and concentrate on cardio during your off time this will give your body a chance to rejuvenate so you can start the competition at peak performance levels
at the event
many first time competitors make three mistakes they dress wrong they eat wrong and they forget to warm up and cool down
when it comes to dress use the same clothing you do your wods in dont try to show off or buy a new outfit just for the event youre going to want something functional and familiar
with all the adrenaline pumping through your system its easy to forget to eat your body needs fuel so set up a series of reminders to tell you when to eat and dont skip any meals during the event
warming up and cooling down between sessions is critical improper warmups increase the chance of injury and improper cooldowns will overheat you and drain your stamina keep your flexfit mat within reach during the event so you can warmup or cooldown at will
after the event
after the event make sure to keep a record of all your times on all the sessions you participated in many first time competitors surprise themselves with how well they do and you can track your improvements against this record in the months to come during successive events try to keep similar records of events you take part in so you can watch your scores improve over time"

the idea that the smart devices in your home and on your phone are listening to youand recording what you are sayingis nothing new and many americans have become complacent with the breach of their privacy because of the convenience provided by the technology however it is still possible to maintain some crucial privacy with some of the most popular apps here are a few steps you can take
facebook
no matter what crazy updates or changes the app undergoes the fact is that facebook is a monster and whether they criticize it or not more than 1 billion people have facebook accounts
one of the many problems with facebook is that one of its updates has included giving the app access to your microphone when you use facebook messenger while the excuse facebook gave was that it needed access to the microphone in order to shoot live video within the app the idea that facebook has access to your smart phones microphone at all times is unsettling to say the least
iphone users go to settings click on privacy click on microphone and then slide the switch to the left on messenger turning it from green to white to turn it off
android users go to settings click on applications then click on application manager go to facebook click on permissions and then click on turn off the mic
siri
iphone users are all too familiar with the virtual friend living inside their smartphone and while users often ask siri a range of random questions she is always listeningand even if the device is locked saying hey siri records your request and uploads the audio file to apples servers for processing
for iphones using ios 8 and later apple has made it so that even when the device is locked the command of hey siri will activate the feature and give access to the phone however if you have experienced this new feature you may have found that there are times when siri is activated even though you did not intentionally give the command
how to turn it off click on settings go to siri and then toggle off allow hey siri for more security also toggle off access when locked
google
while iphone users have hey siri android users have ok google which also applies to google home speakers with this feature when a user says ok google the device automatically begins recording and the audio it obtains is saved to your google account
how to turn it off on android devices go to settings click on google then click on voice and turn off ok google detection
cortana
for microsoft users there is an equivalent to the voiceactivated assistants hey siri and ok google called hey cortana which has similar features
the same privacy concerns have been raised by users who are worried about the amount of data microsoft devices are storing as soon as the command hey cortana is allegedly heard
how to turn it off on your windows computer go to cortana select the notebook icon in the right column click on settings and then toggle off hey cortana
amazon echo
amazon presents a new challenge based on the fact that the assistant on its echo device is not just activated by a phrase such as hey alexa instead it is activated by a number of wake words including alexa amazon computer and echo
while it is possible to turn off the microphone by clicking a button on top of the echo device that microphone is required to use the device in the first place however users do have the ability to track what alexa has recorded and to delete it
to track and delete recordings open the alexa app click on settings then click on history you can then select and delete each entry

shades of taylor mac and the cabaret band the skivvies for sure but the voice ms oh is channeling is her own as she talks about gender race class and the shame so many people experience about sexual desire shed like to banish that feeling along with the everyday predation and abuse that put women and queer people at risk
its hard material to tackle in a performance intended to entertain but ms oh mostly manages that her stage persona is funny irreverent and approachable her band is terrific and her songs cycle lushly through a whole range of moods from danceparty exuberance to mournful darkness in this bubbleblowing confettithrowing show the lighting by kate mcgee keeps things gorgeous with a breeze softly riffling the sets tinselcurtain backdrop
who wants to make out with me onstage right now ms oh inquires well into the performance and that is not by a long shot the most daring thing she asks a spectator to do someone may leave the theater with a freshly shaved head but it doesnt have to be you the night i saw the show a woman in front volunteered immediately for kissing then turned shy

i got carried away she told ms oh my children are in the room
but the woman didnt back out and what followed was the gentlest possible demonstration of ms oh asking for and getting consent step by step it was startlingly sweet and sexy not least because it was so respectful thats the sort of thing this show does puts drabsounding ideals into action and blindsides you with the resulting loveliness
stop right here if you dont want to know how my lingerie play ends its the one section of the show with mandatory audience participation and when ms oh explained what she wanted us to do move to the edges of the theater and form a circle it seemed impractical awkward and offputtingly kumbaya
all of which it is yet the idea that the performers and audience are simply people in a room together as ms oh says is central to the power of the show dutifully we took our places in the circle looking across the theater at one another as the band played one last song and the audience joined in on the chorus
the surprise was how moving the moment turned out to be strangers standing shoulder to shoulder raising their voices together to make a glorious sound"

"__label__real washington reuters scientists have answered one of natures most pungent questions what gives the worlds smelliest fruit its distinctive aroma
scientists in singapore said on monday they have mapped the genome of the durian known throughout southeast asia as the king of fruits for its unique smell flavor and formidable spiny appearance
they identified a group of genes responsible for odor compounds called volatile sulfur compounds and found that these genes become highly activated as the fruit ripens driving its unusual smell
the durian smell has been described as a mix of an onionlike sulfury aroma with notes of sweet fruitiness and savory soupseasoning a key component of the durian smell are volatile sulfur compounds or vscs which have been characterized as decaying onionlike rotten eggs sulfury and fried shallots said geneticist bin tean teh deputy director of the national cancer center singapore coleader of the study published in the journal nature genetics
unlike other plant species that typically have one or two copies of these genes this species boasted four copies demonstrating that vsc production is as teh put it turbocharged in durian fruits
the researchers said this odor may be important to the durian in the wild helping to attract animals to eat it and disperse its seeds
file photo a customer leans forward to smell the king of fruits the exotic asian durian in downtown singapore on april 11 1999 reuterssimon thongfile photo
the scientists sequenced the genome of the musang king variety of durian discovering it has about 46000 genes nearly double the number in the human genome
they were able to trace the evolution of the fruit back 65 million years finding an ancient relationship to the cacao tree whose seeds produce chocolate
most of us in singapore have grown up with the durian and we are very familiar with it said geneticist patrick tan a professor at dukenus medical school in singapore however even within the same family there are individuals that love the taste while others have learned to simply tolerate it especially during durian season for those who have never experienced durian before it can indeed elicit opposing emotions of devotion and revulsion
durian is eaten fresh cooked fermented or as an ingredient in candies baked goods and other food
the researchers said there are at least 30 other durian species some edible some inedible and some with other distinctive features several are endangered
durian is economically important with imports to china last year worth 600 million to 800 million the researchers said"

the controversial organization defense distributed just made it easier to create your own untraceable handguns
on october 1 cody wilson and defense distributed began selling two of the most common handgun 80 percent receivers in addition to selling a computernumericallycontrolled cnc mill which can complete unfinished lower receivers for ar15 semiauto rifles defense distributed will now sell unfinished receivers for glocks and singlestack m1911s
using defense distributeds mill known as the ghost gunner anyone with 1600 and some basic milling knowledge can create the lower receiver of an ar15 rifle the term ghost guns was first popularized by gun control advocates because the weapons do not have a serial number and are thus untraceable wilson and defense distributed have since reclaimed the term in a sort of sendup to the us government which the company is still fighting over the alleged violations of the international traffic in arms regulations
its a certain type of person who builds and enjoys an ar15thats a lot of gun and most people dont feel the need to have a big ol battle rifle wilson told arstechnica but we believe lots of people are interested in the conversation about an untraceable concealable handgun its been on the roadmap the whole time for this project its just always been a question of how we get there and it ended up being very very difficultkinda like the brass ring of the project if you will
just like the ars and stuff youre making the identical item that you would otherwise handle purchase and fireso it feels identical wilson notes these are real guns
wilson is a former university of texas school of law student who gained notoriety in the tech world for his involvement in a series of controversial digital projects including dark wallet an application to make bitcoin transactions anonymous and untraceable and his efforts to spread firearms blueprints to the public via downloadable files in january wired named wilson one of the most dangerous people on the internet right now putting him in league with edward snowden the national security agency and north korean leader kim jongun
in may 2013 defense distributed released a video of wilson firing the worlds first fully 3d printable firearm the 16piece liberator 380 single shot pistol they also released the 3d printable files to the internet within days the state department demanded that the files be removed from public access citing a violation of the international traffic in arms regulations defense distributed complied though wilson admitted to forbes that removing all relevant data from public access might be an impossible standard
with the release of the new lower receivers advocates of gun ownership and privacy have achieved a victory the government could not stop the spread of these weapons or this technology if it tried it will eventually try and the cody wilsons of the world will do everything they can to break past the barriers set by the state obviously individuals with ill intent could make use of this tech just as the privacy advocate who wants to protect her family might make use of it we cannot allow fear of bad men using these weapons drive us to support attempts at banning or restricting access tyrants want the people in fear and without a means for defense dont fall prey to the manipulation and fear porn

before its news

you probably cant boil donald trumps election victory last year down to any one specific issue but if you could youd be hard pressed to name anything other than immigration it was on this issue that trump recognized what his fellow republicans to a large extent could not or would not that the unrestrained acceptance of illegal immigrants and refugees from dangerous countries around the world would mean certain doom for our country maybe not tomorrow or the day after but very soon and for proof of that fact one need only look across the sea to germany france and other european nations who realized too late what muslim immigration had done to their communities
even in an environment where terrorist attacks have become commonplace of course globalist leaders like angela merkel refuse to take concrete steps to protect their countries that is why despite merkels reelection last week germany put afd party representatives in parliament for the first time the far right is gaining steam in germany and there can be no doubt as to why citizens liberal as they may be in regards to many other issues see all too clearly that the people theyre letting into their country do not share their values even those who would not dream of bombing a concert hall want to implement restrictions on speech women and other western liberties
last week in a move that invited predictable criticism from the united nations and the liberal media the very same critics who think everything is just peachy in europe president trump signed two orders that will prevent the us from repeating our allies mistakes the first an update of the travel ban that expired last month the new ban drops sudan from the list of banned countries and adds chad north korea and to a limited extent venezuela the second a new limit on the number of annual refugees the us will take in the old limit in excess of 100000 has been dropped in favor of a 45000 individual cap the actual number given the increased vetting promised by this administration could turn out to be much lower
in his speech to the un last month president trump outlined the reasons why limiting refugee acceptance was not only crucial but sensible from a humanitarian standpoint
over the long term uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries he said for the sending countries it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms for the receiving countries the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by lowincome citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government
for the cost of resettling one refugee in the united states we can assist more than 10 in their home region trump continued out of the goodness of our hearts we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region and we support recent agreements of the g20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible
critics of the trump administration paint the new policies as coldhearted racist and antithetical to the spirit of america they couldnt be more wrong the hard truth is that the us is only a beacon of freedom might and wealth to the world as long as we maintain our strength it does no one any good except the islamists and the socialists for our country to go down with the ship and as long as we have president trump in the white house and a grassroots movement deadset against turning this country into just another liberal nation of fools the us will stand strong and tall while the rest fall

the use of information to enhance martial power goes back to the beginning of human civilization itself where propaganda and psychological warfare went handinhand with slings arrows swords and shields
the most recent iteration of this takes the form of social media and cyberwarfare where tools are being developed and deployed to influence populations at home and abroad to manipulate political processes of foreign states and even tap into and exploit global economic forces
in the beginning of the 21st century the united states held an uncontested monopoly over the tools of cyberwarfare today this is changing quickly presenting an increasingly balanced cyberscape where nations are able to defend themselves on near parity with americas ability to attack them
to reassert americas control over information and the technology used to broker it jared cohen current google employee and former us state department staff has proposed a uscreated and dominated international framework regarding cyberconflict
his oped in the new york times titled how to prevent a cyberwar begins by admitting the very pretext the us is using to expand its control over cyberwarfare is baseless noting that specifics of russias interference in the 2016 america election remain unclear
regardless cohen continues by laying out a plan for reasserting american control over cyberwarfare anyway by claiming
cyberweapons wont go away and their spread cant be controlled instead as weve done for other destructive technologies the world needs to establish a set of principles to determine the proper conduct of governments regarding cyberconflict they would dictate how to properly attribute cyberattacks so that we know with confidence who is responsible and they would guide how countries should respond
cohen unsurprisingly nominates the us to lead and direct these efforts
the united states is uniquely positioned to lead this effort and point the world toward a goal of an enforceable cyberwarfare treaty many of the institutions that would be instrumental in informing these principles are based in the united states including research universities and the technology industry part of this effort would involve leading by example and the united states can and should establish itself as a defender of a free and open internet everywhere
cohen never explains how this usdominated framework will differ from existing international frameworks regarding conventional warfare the us regularly abuses to justify a growing collection of devastating conflicts it is waging worldwide
and as has been repeatedly documented the united states definition of a free and open internet everywhere is an internet dominated by us tech companies seeking to enhance and expand us interests globally
cohen ironically notes that
cyberweapons have already been used by governments to interfere with elections steal billions of dollars harm critical infrastructure censor the press manipulate public conversations about crucial issues and harass dissidents and journalists the intensity of cyberconflict around the world is increasing and the tools are becoming cheaper and more readily available
indeed cyberweapons have already been used primarily by the united states
jared cohen himself was directly involved in joint operations between google facebook the us state department and a number of other us tech and media enterprises which before and during 2011 set the stage for the socalled arab spring
it included the training funding and equipping of activists years ahead of the the uprisings as well as active participation in the uprisings themselves including providing assistance to both protesters and militants everywhere from libya to syria in overthrowing governments targeted by washington for regime change
one such tool used in these efforts was described in a uk independent article titled google planned to help syrian rebels bring down assad regime leaked hillary clinton emails claim which would report that
an interactive tool created by google was designed to encourage syrian rebels and help bring down the assad regime hillary clintons leaked emails have reportedly revealed by tracking and mapping defections within the syrian leadership it was reportedly designed to encourage more people to defect and give confidence to the rebel opposition
the article would continue mentioning jared cohen by name
the email detailing googles defection tracker purportedly came from jared cohen a clinton advisor until 2010 and nowpresident of jigsaw formerly known as google ideas the companys new yorkbased policy think tank wire tapped america new free book ad in a july 2012 email to members of clintons team which the wikileaks release alleges was later forwarded to the secretary of state herself cohen reportedly said my team is planning to launch a tool on sunday that will publicly track and map the defections in syria and which parts of the government they are coming from
would cohens more recently proposed framework have prevented the united states use of these cyberweapons against sovereign states to undermine sociopolitical stability overturn entire governments and plunge them into enduring chaos many still remain in 6 years later most likely not
what cohen and the interests he represents are truly concerned with is that nations are now not only able to recognize prepare for and defend against us cyberwarfare they may be capable of retaliating against the us
cohens proposal for an international framework to govern cyberwarfare simply seeks to define it in terms that leaves the us with both an uncontested monopoly over cyberwarfare as well as the means to wield it globally with absolute impunity
it would be not unlike current international frameworks used to govern conflicts between nations which the us has used to justify an expansive global campaign of extraterritorial war stretching from north africa to central asia and beyond
such frameworks have become enablers of injustice not a deterrence to it
as nations from iran to north korea are discovering the only true means of defending oneself from foreign military aggression is creating a plausible deterrence to dissuade foreign nations from attacking this is done by creating a price for attacking and invading that is higher than the perceived benefits of doing so
nations like russia and china have already achieved this balance with the united states in terms of conventional and nuclear warfare and have now nearly established a similar deterrence in terms of cyber and information warfare for the rest of the world developing cyberdefense is not as costly as conventional military or nuclear arsenals making cyberwarfare a corner of the battlefield unlikely to be monopolized by the us as it had done at the turn of the century
ensuring that no single nation ever has the opportunity to abuse such a monopoly again means exposing and confronting efforts by those like googles jared cohen and his proposal for an international framework for cyberwarfare that resembles the same sort of enabling the united nations provides the us in terms of proliferating conventional conflicts across the globe

"__label__real parliamentary floor leader of the christian social union csu alexander dobrindt gives an interview in berlin germany october 10 2017 reutersreinhard krause
berlin reuters germany may need to wait until next year for a new government as the three blocs trying to form an alliance are so far apart they will need a deeply detailed coalition deal a senior bavarian ally of chancellor angela merkel has told reuters
alexander dobrindt parliamentary floor leader of the christian social union csu said a coalition agreement would have to be more precise than the one that accompanied the rightleft grand coalition in the last parliament
after 12 years in power merkel was humbled in last months national election by a surge of the antiimmigrant far right and she must now broker a threeway coalition of her conservatives the probusiness free democrats fdp and the greens a combination previously untested at the federal level
the task is further complicated by the fact that merkels conservative bloc compromises her christian democratic union cdu and the rightleaning bavarian csu whose alliance has been strained by her opendoor migrants policy
the conservative allies removed one obstacle to forming a new coalition on sunday by agreeing a limit on the number of migrants arriving in germany sought by the csu but dobrindt said in an interview with reuters television that securing a threeway alliance would be difficult
as we know that the points that separate us outweigh those we have in common one can have doubts about whether a coalition agreement is possible this year he said it is conceivable that we cant complete in december and that final talks if there even are any will only possible next year
the threeway tieup dubbed a jamaica coalition after the black green and yellow colors of the three party blocs that match the caribbean nations flag is merkels only realistic option of forming a government
the centerleft social democrats her previous partners in an awkward grand coalition insist they now want to go into opposition
a jamaica coalition was formed in the tiny western german state of saarland in october 2009 but collapsed in january 2012 the same formation took power in the far northern region of schleswigholstein after elections there in may this year
big differences
at a national level the cducsu fdp and greens have deep differences on issues ranging from migration to european union reform tax and the environment
parliamentary floor leader of the christian social union csu alexander dobrindt gives an interview in berlin germany october 10 2017 reutersreinhard krause
but merkel asked in an interview with the rnd group of newspapers whether such a coalition could nonetheless come to pass said the parties had a mandate from voters that they needed to take on
its our joint responsibility our duty in fact to form a government from that and to pursue sensible policies for our citizens and country i think thats possible she said
dobrindt said diverging opinions between the three parties meant they would have to nail down an indepth deal
we need in a possible jamaica coalition agreement a significantly higher level of detail than was the case with the grand coalition he said the differences between the parties are big so the agreements need to go deeper
slideshow 4 images
in their compromise struck on sunday the cdu and csu agreed to limit to 200000 the number of newcomers germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds
the fdp and greens insist the conservatives agreement cannot simply be copied into a coalition deal
senior greens member juergen trittin accused the conservatives on tuesday of violating christian values because they wanted to keep suspending family reunifications for migrants granted subsidiary protection those who do not qualify as refugees but need international protection
fdp deputy head wolfgang kubicki told deutschlandfunk radio the conservative deal would not form the basis for cooperation and would not be implemented the way it had been agreed saying that wont happen
but dobrindt whose csu is worried about losing its regional dominance in bavarias state election next year said the allies accord must be reflected in a coalition deal
the regulations we have made in our joint paper rules on migration are of course an essential part of the negotiations and must also be found in a coalition agreement
the intransigence of the csu greens and fdp on the migrants issue points to difficult coalition talks that risk clouding the political outlook in germany which has been a source of stability in europe during merkels tenure
we want europe to concentrate more on the big tasks and less on the small tasks dobrindt said that means we must talk about bringing back responsibilities from brussels to germany and the details of that will no doubt be difficult"
"__label__real ive heard it before girardi said they boo players and managers who have much more status than i do
nobody knows what happens next for girardi of course if the yanks go on to lose this series if they do game 2 may yet come back to haunt him and the franchise other yankee managers have bitten the dust after successful regular seasons that were followed by disappointing playoff performances dick howser in 1980 and buck showalter in 1995 did not return after postseason setbacks
those impulsive goodbyes however were engineered by george steinbrenner not his more eventempered son hal before the game speaking with reporters who cover the team girardi was uncharacteristically forthcoming about his own job security

an organization has to do what they are comfortable with girardi said and it may not always agree with the person being fired or however it goes but that is hals and brians decision and whatever their decision is i will live with it
girardi has won 910 games over the last decade as the yankees manager but only one world championship ten years ago these same opponents the indians proved to be the undoing of a different yankees manager in that instance joe torre failed to pull his team off the field in protest when joba chamberlain was befelled by a swarm of midges in game 2 of a playoff series in cleveland
a distracted chamberlain threw a critical wild pitch that tied the score and the yankees went on to lose the game and then the series torre later called that nonaction on his part his greatest managerial regret and in the aftermath of that series he failed to come to terms with george steinbrenner on a new contract
advertisement continue reading the main story
meanwhile despite the negative welcome girardi received on sunday not every yankee fan was ready to throw him under the no 4 train
im sticking with girardi at this point said marc chalpin of manhattan another bleacher denizen hes the secondbest yankee manager ever after billy martin he messed up on friday but when mariano rivera blew game 7 in 2001 it didnt negate his body of work
if the yanks do survive this round girardi will be introduced again at yankee stadium before the american league championship series should he get that far he probably wont need to warn the wife and kids about what they are about to hear"

"__label__real supporters of the opposition national super alliance nasa coalition carry banners and react during a protest calling for the sacking of election board officials involved in augusts cancelled presidential vote in nairobi kenya october 9 2017 reutersthomas mukoya
nairobi reuters kenyan police fired teargas and shots in the air on monday as hundreds of demonstrators marched through the capital nairobi to protest against proposed legal changes that would make it harder for the supreme court to annul an election
reuters television footage showed a sport utility vehicle ploughing into some of the protesters severely injuring three but it was not immediately clear who was responsible and the police made no immediate comment on the incident
kenya is due on oct 26 to repeat a presidential election after the supreme court nullified an aug 8 vote due to procedural irregularities president uhuru kenyatta who won the august election will face opposition leader raila odinga
uncertainty over the coming election has created turmoil in the east african nation which is a regional trade hub and staunch western ally
as the demonstrators marched toward the election board in nairobi a reuters journalist saw men in plain clothes near security forces fire shots in the air police on horseback set up blockades to prevent protesters from accessing some roads
police also used teargas in the western city of kisumu odingas stronghold to disperse protesters though another demonstration in the coastal city of mombasa passed peacefully
odingas opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the october vote unless the electoral board changes some personnel a stance he declined on monday to clarify in comments that suggested he was keeping his options open for now
this is a democratic society we live in if i choose not to participate in the prerigged election process it is my democratic right no court can order me to do so odinga said in comments broadcast on kenyan tv stations without elaborating further

the protesters want to warn ruling party lawmakers not to pass an amendment to the election law that would limit the circumstances in which the supreme court could void an election on procedural grounds opposition lawmaker james orengo said
if parliament passes the law tomorrow it will be like declaring war on the kenyan people he said

justin muturi speaker of the national assembly said the amendment could be debated when parliament reconvenes on tuesday if lawmakers were keen to push it forward
he said the key part of the proposed law stipulates that if a candidate boycotts an election whose date has already been set the remaining candidate would win the contest without formal polls being held
the government is keen to avoid a constitutional crisis if odinga pulls out at the last minute frustrating the courts order to hold elections within 60 days muturi said
we are trying to prevent a crisis should there be no elections he told reuters by phone
the governmentbacked kenya national commission on human rights said on monday in a report that at least 37 people had been killed in a police crackdown on protests that immediately followed the august vote the highest death toll given so far
the report attributed some deaths to police using live bullets and a few from police bludgeoning using clubs it named a 6monthold baby girl a 7yearold boy and an 8yearold girl as being among the victims

"__label__fake week 5 rankings 2017 top 40 running backs
before its news
by ray kuhn
this is not an easy week as we have four teams on bye and week 4 saw multiple running backs go down with injury while the options at the top of the rankings are as strong as ever it gets thin quick unless you are looking for value options in dfs it is going to be a week where you jump to the top of the list and pay the premium when it comes to seasonal leagues there isnt the same luxury and there will be some speculation involved lets take a look at how our options rank this week

notes
one of the worst injuries we saw this past sunday was chris carson going down with a broken ankle despite the loss seattles backfield is still pretty crowded but the rookie had taken the lead in the hierarchy i wouldnt read too much into the fact that thomas rawls was inactive last week as he doesnt contribute in any other areas of the game besides carrying the football following carsons injury pete carroll talked up rawls as his replacement even though he has just five carries for four yards so far this season eddie lacy will also be a factor he carried the ball 11 times for 52 yards last week but its worth taking a shot on rawls to see if he can recreate the magic from prior seasons cj prosise assuming he returns from his ankle injury will be a factor on passing downs but i wouldnt be surprised to see rawls take advantage of the rams 32nd ranked defense against opposing running backs
the cardinals lost their starting running back in week 1 and they are still looking to replace david johnson in reality they arent going to but as we enter week 5 andre ellington looks to be the closest option to do so arizona does have a tough matchup in philadelphia and their offense hasnt exactly been strong so far but ellington had himself quite a game last week he was targeted 14 times and caught nine passes for 86 yards while just missing a 12 yard touchdown as he stepped out of bounds in the past he has had success running the ball but last week he gained just 18 yards on five carries however it is not like chris johnson is doing that much better on the ground as he gained 32 yards on 13 carries at this pointellington is the back to own as at the very least he will get plenty of work in the passing game
just like that green bay is down to their number three running back in aaron jones while ty montgomery hasnt been officially ruled out with broken ribs im not expecting to see him out on the field in week 5 and joseph williams doesnt appear to be a factor thanks to his knee injury that brings us to jones who had success last week while making his nfl debut he had his share of success in college but his pro career consists of 13 carries for 49 yards and a touchdown green bay is a strong offense which should benefit jones as will facing dallas who has the 26th ranked fantasy defense against the run
another rookie running back who made his debut last week is wayne gallman unlike jones gallman is part of an offense and a team that is a complete mess while orleans darkwa was inactive due to a back injury gallman got his chance mainly thanks to the ineffectiveness of paul perkins the giants havent gotten much going on offense this season so it is likely that they will stick with gallman as long as it continues to work he gained 42 yards on 11 carries while catching another two passes for eight yards and finding the end zone with new yorks struggles on the offensive line gallmans running style is a better fit
the last two weeks houstons offense has come around and last week lamar miller was truly a part of that he found the end zone for the first time all season as he picked up both a rushing and receiving touchdown against the titans so far he has managed to hold off donta foreman and he is averaging 17 carries per game the problem is that while miller is getting the work he is averaging just 38 yards per carry it does work in his favor that the texans offense really seems to be getting on track with deshaun watson under center on a per carry basis foreman isnt much better than miller and the veterans dependability certainly has fantasy value
for the second straight week alex collins gained 82 yards on nine carries and it appears he has left terrance west in the dust collins also caught four passes for 32 yards but that doesnt mean we dont have questions he fumbled once again on sunday and this is not a new problem despite the fact that he led baltimore in carries collins was only on the field for 17 plays while buck allen saw 40 snaps allen carried the ball twice while catching six passes for 37 yards that appears to be the ceiling for allen while if baltimore and collins can get past the fumbles he could get into double digits carrying the ball there is some value in that especially this week depending on your situation

before its news
by ray kuhn
with odell beckham healthy and scoring touchdowns again and the jets actually winning a game two of our defensive targets from previous weeks are not as viable as they once were that doesnt mean we cant target either team or that there arent any other teams to target it just means we need to reevaluate our process a bit lets take a look at how the defenses rank for this week
seattle seahawks vs indianapolis green bay packers vs chicago cincinnati bengals at cleveland tampa bay buccaneers vs new york giants tennessee titans at houston jacksonville jaguars at new york jets philadelphia eagles at la chargers detroit lions at minnesota arizona cardinals vs san francisco kansas city chiefs vs washington pittsburgh steelers at baltimore new england patriots vs carolina miami dolphins vs new orleans dallas cowboys vs la rams san diego chargers vs philadelphia
notes
just because the colts got into the win column last week and jacoby brissett has emerged as a sneaky cheap quarterback option it doesnt mean we shouldnt target indianapolis while the colts did score 31 points last week it came against the 03 browns and in three games brissett only has three total touchdowns one passing and two rushing last week was rough for seattle as the titans put up 33 points but in the prior two games they allowed a total of 26 points seattle is not as strong of an option as they once were they are still a solid defense with some of the same players from when they were a top defense off the board the main issue is that need to create turnovers with two interceptions they will also benefit as the colts have allowed 11 sacks seattle has six which makes them one of the top plays this week
it has been a forgettable start to the season for new englands defense through three games they have given up an average of 32 points and 461 yards and the initial thought would be to look the other way the patriots get what could turn out to be a gift this week as they face cam newton and the panthers im not sure how much that should count for since new england gave up 27 points to a rookie quarterback last week but newton has not looked good and was the first signal caller to struggle against new orleans defense if you are looking for positives the patriots did pick off deshaun watson twice last week and they have averaged two sacks a week i have a hard time betting against new england and if your streaming options arent great there are worse things than holding on that is especially true since there arent many slam dunk matchups this week
this isnt about targeting the jets as much as it is giving credit to jacksonville after almost shutting out the ravens last week perhaps the jaguars defense is truly a legitimate fantasy option for this season when they held the texans to just seven points in the season opener while coming up with an interception three fumble recoveries and scoring a touchdown that was chalked up to tom savage more than anything else it looked like the bounced back to earth in a big way by giving up 37 points to the titans but its hard to argue with the success they had last week despite the 20 points new york scored last week they are still not an intimidating offense

"__label__real cnn when jay park became one of the first and only asian artists signed to jayzs label roc nation earlier this summer the hiphop world was rattled
not that park who was born to korean immigrant parents in seattle was overly concerned in fact its the type of thing hes grown accustomed to
me being asianamerican i was always looked at as an outsider i always had to fight for my place park told cnn during a recent interview
for an outsider park is very much in at present the 30yearold rapper has seen his celebrity status soar in recent months in addition to working on his debut roc nation album hes also preparing to join the second season of asias got talent as a judge the popular show premieres october 12 across 27 countries in asia
jay park has clearly become an icon for those struggling to make a name for themselves said flowsion shekar ceo of koreaboo a popular content platform specializing in kpop with a reach of over 50 million
it shows that asia is not being ignored you can be an rb singer a rapper a singer from asia and have ambitions to takeover a global market you can be recognized by the greats
one cant spin a better comeback story
but success didnt come easy to park
like many asian families parks mom had aspirations for him to be a doctor or lawyer
that wasnt happening because i was skipping school and going breakdancing said park who joined a bboy crew named art of movement
park was curious about hiphop since the second grade convincing an older cousin to share music despite the bad words counting west coast gangsta rapper warren g and the sitcom the fresh prince of belair as inspirations he started rapping by the fourth grade
fortunately for park his mom eventually relented and suggested he enter into a locally advertised talent audition which turned out to be organized by one of the biggest kpop labels jyp entertainment
not thinking much would come of it park then 17 skipped out of the audition early to grab fast food at taco bell
it was left up to his mom who had stayed behind after park had preformed to relay the news that he had been selected to travel to south korea
and so began parks entry into the music industry as the face of kpop boy band 2pm
i thought ill go for a couple of years and help my family out said park
at that time it was just me and mom and my brother having money problems we couldnt pay the electric and water bill
but his new life in seoul proved difficult today park is near fluent in korean but back then was only a beginner
it was really hard to sacrifice my life in seattle and do this thing i knew nothing about said park over the phone from seoul
it was a culture shock the seniority system the food and the way they did things for me it was a hobby and fun but there it was training almost like a job where you have to practice from 10 am to 10 pm
park complained about the challenges of life in the boy band on his myspace page the offensive comments were leaked publicly in 2009 and facing a fan backlash he left the group
we parted ways and i went back to seattle it is what it is says park
new beginnings
after leaving the kpop world park moved back home to the seattle area and started working at a used car shop
while there he uploaded a cover video of bobs hit nothin on you onto youtube inserting his own lyrics and rap
the video went viral with more than two million views in less than a day
i dont give up said park i wasnt attached to the fame or the lifestyle the main point in the beginning was to support my family
jay park originally from seattle is now based in south korea
the videos success helped him to return to the music business creating his own label aomg his fourth solo album everything you wanted was released last october and rose to no 3 on billboards world album chart and no 3 on the itunes us rb chart
me being in the system in a group with the company i didnt have much to express myself said park now i finally have the freedom to do what i wanted to do
his new album representing his style of rap rb and electronica is set to come out next year
they roc nation like the image i have now said park im just me
in addition to aomg hes launched a second label h1ghr music records with artists from the us and asia through his music he hopes to reform the image of the asian male from being seen as people who are good at math to be sexy too
the korean american rapper is now 30
he also dreams of working with rihanna and knows it may be farfetched to work directly with jayz but hes willing to put in the work to make that happen and one day well see
its still crazy to me that he knows who i am said park a longtime jayz fan"

"__label__fake 2018 player to avoid dont buy into avisail garcias breakout
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
weve long heard about the potential of avisail garcia and on the surface it would appear like he finally delivered on it in 2017
518 at bats
330 batting average 171 hits
18 home runs
80 rbi
75 runs
5 stolen bases
380 on base percentage
506 slugging percentage
392 batting average on balls in play
obviously the babip jumps out as unsustainable regardless of any other metrics when you add in a lack of elite foot speed and a pedestrian 203 line drive rate and it looks all the more unrealistic that alone is going to drag down his average but it isnt the only red flag
garcias strikeout rate stood at 198 last season his first year below 230 since breaking into the majors in 2012 and that was based on 47 ab he also continued to show abysmal plate discipline casting even more doubt on his average
swstr 162
oswing 398
a career 277 hitter garcia had posted marks of 257 and 245 the previous two seasons with the babip set to implode and the strikeouts potentially rising significantly that would appear to be a lot closer to the truth at best you have to anticipate a 250ish average and thats simply not going to get the job done considering the other tools
if garcia had the potential to hit 30 hr we may be willing to overlook the average issues however he posted a 522 groundball rate in 17 and owns a 529 mark for his career that is always going to make it difficult for any hitter to post significant power as his 161 hrfb yielded his modest 18 hr total that may be his upside and with the way the ball was flying out of the ballpark in 17 thats not going to get it done
in regards to speed he has never stolen more than 7 bases in the majors and is 23for43 over his major league career
so you have an average thats going to implode coupled with mediocre power and little stolen base potential does that sound like someone youd want to invest in someone in your league may be willing to pay for last seasons average but dont make that mistake

us attorney general jeff sessions is urging congress to promptly reauthorize section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa scheduled to expire at the end of this year
the director of national intelligence dni dan coats also signed the letter addressed to house speaker paul ryan rwis house minority leader nancy pelosi dcalif senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky and senate minority leader chuck schumer dny
section 702 of fisa allows the intelligence community under a robust regime of oversight by all three branches of government to collect vital information about international terrorists cyber actors individuals and entities engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other important foreign intelligence targets located outside the united states sessions and coats wrote
they added reauthorizing this critical authority is the top legislative priority of the department of justice and the intelligence community as publicly reported by the privacy and civil liberties oversight board information collected under one particular section of faa section 702 produces significant foreign intelligence that is vital to protect the nation against international terrorism and other threats
fisa was enacted in 1978 as a response to illegal domestic surveillance operations revealed by two senate committees in the 1970s including president richard nixons use of federal intelligence agencies to monitor his political opponents it was brought into law to authorize electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information
the law requires the government to obtain a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance court before setting up an electronic or physical wiretap targeted at foreigners and foreign agents
congress amended fisa in 2007 to let the government wiretap communications that either begin or end outside the united states jurisdiction without foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc approval in a stronger 2008 overhaul they further limited that power to nonus persons the last reauthorization of the act was in 2012 which set the current expiration date of dec 31 2017
the fisa law has long been criticized by privacy and civil liberties advocates like the eff who say the order allows broad intrusive spying without oversight the section first gained renewed attention following the 2013 disclosures by former national security agency contractor edward snowden that the agency carried out widespread monitoring of emails and other electronic communications through prism xkeyscore upstream and other nsa surveillance programs in fact the first snowden leak was a fisc order issued to verizon under section 702 that required the company to turn over all of its calling records to the nsa
in june earlier this year president trumps homeland security and counterterrorism adviser tom bossert also urged congress to review the piece of legislation before it expires on december 31st

the socalled iran nuclear deal officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa was hailed as historic when the united states among other nations became a signatory of it thenus president barack obama attempted to make convincing statements regarding americas commitment to the deal
however americas rhetoric compared to its actual actions diplomatically militarily and geopolitically told two different stories
us was waging proxy war with iran when the deal was signed
the deal was created in 2015 4 full years since the united states engineered a destructive proxy war in syria one of irans closest and most crucial regional allies by 2015 the united states had already committed to direct military intervention in syria occupying syrian territory directly arming funding and providing air support for militants seizing syrian territory and even constructing military bases within syrias borders
by 2015 the united states was revealed to have poured billions of dollars into arming militants ranging from kurdish groups in syrias northeast to militants aligned to al qaeda and even the socalled islamic state isis in northern and southern syria
while us president barack obama posed as conciliatory toward iran the us was steeped deeply in not only a proxy war against syria but ultimately a proxy war aimed directly at iran
according to years of us policy papers dismantling irans allies in syria and lebanon were crucial prerequisites toward eventually undermining and overthrowing the government and political order in iran itself
in 2009 us corporatefinancier sponsored geopolitical policy think tank the brookings institution would publish a 170page report titled which path to persia options for a new american strategy toward iran pdf in which it proposes several options including having israel attack iran on washingtons behalf the report states emphasis added
the israelis may want us help with a variety of things israel may be more willing to bear the risks of iranian retaliation and international opprobrium than the united states is but it is not invulnerable and may request certain commitments from the united states before it is ready to strike for instance the israelis may want to hold off until they have a peace deal with syria in hand assuming that jerusalem believes that one is within reach which would help them mitigate blowback from hizballah and potentially hamas consequently they might want washington to push hard in mediating between jerusalem and damascus
in hindsight it is clear that no peace deal would be struck with syria and instead the wholesale destruction of syria would be orchestrated many of the proposals presented in the brookings report in regards to triggering conflict and regime change in iran have been instead used on syria
betraying the nuclear deal is stated us policy
signing an agreement posing as rapprochement while simultaneously waging proxy war against a principle party of the agreement already indicates us intentions regarding iran and americas commitment to honoring the agreement
beyond us policymakers openly conspiring to weaken or altogether dismantle irans regional allies before setting upon iran directly years before the jcpoa was signed us policymakers pledged to propose then intentionally betray a superb offer to help portray iran rather than the united states as both an irrational threat to global security and a nation bent on acquiring nuclear weapons for the wrong reasons
the 2009 brookings institution report which path to persia would explicitly describe this ploy stating
any military operation against iran will likely be very unpopular around the world and require the proper international contextboth to ensure the logistical support the operation would require and to minimize the blowback from it the best way to minimize international opprobrium and maximize support however grudging or covert is to strike only when there is a widespread conviction that the iranians were given but then rejected a superb offerone so good that only a regime determined to acquire nuclear weapons and acquire them for the wrong reasons would turn it down under those circumstances the united states or israel could portray its operations as taken in sorrow not anger and at least some in the international community would conclude that the iranians brought it on themselves by refusing a very good deal
shortly before us president barack obama ended his second term in office preparations were already underway to backtrack on the iran deal with us president donald trump now presiding over us foreign policy the us is preparing to either entirely withdraw from the deal or rewrite its conditions in such a fashion that iran will be unable to accept it
as the end game approaches in syria
while regime change and the total division and destruction of syria would have been ideal for us policymakers who then seek to wage war upon iran syria and its allies have paid a significant price in personnel and materiel
despite this syrian forces have retaken virtually all significant population centers across the nation including syrias largest city aleppo where reconstruction is already beginning syrian forces have also crossed and are currently establishing a stronghold east of the euphrates river further complicating the partitioning of syrian territory as envisioned by us policymakers and their kurdish and arab proxies
with russian and iranian forces deeply dug in on the ground in syria the likelihood of the us and its partners making any further headway against syria is unlikely and faces a now or never moment in regards to pivoting the conflict and its regional resources toward iran reconstruction in syria and the loosening of sanctions versus iran will only further impede possible future operations against iran
us forfeits illusion of independent israeli foreign policy
signaling increasing signs of desperation and aggression the us has opened its first official military base in what has for all intents and purposes been for decades a forward operating base for wall street and washington in the middle east israel
for the first time in history the united states on monday established an official permanent military base in israel an air defense base in the heart of the negev desert dozens of us air force soldiers will call home the new base located inside the israeli air forces mashabim air base west of the towns of dimona and yerucham brig gen tzvika haimovitch head of the iafs aerial defense command announced the establishment of the installation on monday evening its nothing short of historic he said it demonstrates the yearsold alliance between the united states and the state of israel
while it is indeed historic it is also notable for the significant concession it represents for decades angloamerican interests benefited from the perception that israel possessed its own aggressive independent foreign policy maintaining this perception allowed the us and its western allies to use israel to carry out regional aggression while maintaining plausible deniability
the aforementioned brookings document specifically cited this as one of several possible means for provoking war with iran by having israel appear to unilaterally attack iran with the us only joining in direct military intervention once iran either committed to retaliation or a staged attack on israel could be blamed on iran
with a permanent us military base on israeli soil plausible deniability and the illusion of an independent israeli foreign policy vanishes completely this may signal a much more blunt approach by washington regarding any upcoming aggression against both syria and iran
regional consolidation in preparation for what
the us finds itself overtly consolidating its positions in the middle east at a time when the global balance of power teeters dangerously close to irrevocably undoing american hegemony
preparing the middle east for war with iran has been a workinprogress since the end of the cold war it is an agenda that has transcended multiple us presidencies and has included everything from usbacked terrorism in the form of organizations like mojahedine khalq mek to usbacked color revolutions like the green revolution in 2009 to the current proxy war being waged against syria and the ongoing diplomatic maneuvering surrounding the iranian nuclear deal
radical shifts in us policy regarding iran are not owed to new occupants in the white house but rather the shifting geopolitical realities as the us declines and other nations incrementally rise upon the world stage today the us has exhausted its international clout repeatedly abused international mechanisms for conflict resolution and is openly pursuing a war in syria with the aid of militant groups internationally designated as terrorist organizations as its ability to wage war against ian behind a smokescreen of legitimacy dwindles the likelihood of it openly carrying out an act of aggression increases
us policymakers may hope that after consolidating its positions in the middle east it can carry out a single sweeping act of military aggression irans allies will be unable or unwilling to contest
desperate hegemons are dangerous hegemons

president donald trump told reporters tuesday morning that he will visit the devastated us territory of puerto rico next tuesday
the president speaking just before a briefing on hurricane recovery efforts said that he will visit puerto rico and perhaps the us virgin islands next week to inspect the damage meet with officials survivors and first responders
trump said that next tuesday is likely the first chance he could go without disrupting ongoing recovery efforts
puerto rico is very important to me he said and puerto rico the people are very important to me
trump remarked monday on twitter about the devastation on the island territory
texas florida are doing great but puerto rico which was already suffering from broken infrastructure massive debt is in deep trouble he tweeted its old electrical grid which was in terrible shape was devastated much of the island was destroyed with billions of dollars owed to wall street and the banks which sadly must be dealt with food water and medical are top priorities and doing well
restoration of power will take months but bringing the island back as a hub of carribean tourism could take years an economic hit that an already bankrupt region will struggle to survive
the fact that puerto rico is distant from the mainland and is an island is slowing aid efforts damage to the major airport is extensive and restricting capacity just 16 commercial flights arrived and departed on monday boarding passes are filled out by hand the air traffic control system is severely damaged and the number of military and aid flights is consuming most of the airports capacity
the cargo port is still closed despite it being a priority while military flights are creating an air bridge to bring in food medical supplies and generators cargo ships can move more supplies more efficiently being able to receive supplies by ship would also free up capacity at the airport for commercial flights

beirut reuters iran will react sharply to any us move against the nuclear deal with global powers foreign minister mohammad javad zarif told the iranian parliament wednesday according to a parliamentarian who attended the session quoted by state media
the comments were the latest in a series of tough remarks from irans leadership showing a united front between its pragmatist and hardline factions as us president donald trump prepares to harden policy towards tehran this week
in the closed session zarif emphasized that if the americans take any steps against the nuclear deal that the islamic republic of iran will give them a more crushing response shahbaz hassanpour a lawmaker representing the city of sirjan told the islamic republic news agency irna
another lawmaker behrouz nemati said the foreign minister discussed specific steps trump and the us congress might take and irans plans for reciprocal action to each anticipated us move nemati did not say what actions zarif had described
trump is expected this week to decertify the landmark 2015 deal under which iran agreed with global powers to accept curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions
decertification would not by itself withdraw the united states from the agreement but would pass that decision on to congress requiring lawmakers to decide within 60 days whether to reimpose sanctions
trump is also expected to declare irans revolutionary guards corps a terrorist organization since the guards have a vast economic empire in iran such a declaration could make it more difficult for iranian businesses to access the international financial system
washington has already blacklisted other entities and individuals for supporting guards activities but has not blacklisted the guards themselves
the threat of increased us pressure has been met by a united front of criticism from within iran with members of the pragmatic faction that seeks greater interaction with the west showing their support for the hardline guards
iranian newspapers ran photos on tuesday of zarif the urbane useducated foreign minister laughing and hugging the head of the guards mohammad ali jafari

aaron judge put what could be his final touch on a likely rookie of the year campaign going 13 with 1 hr 1 rbi and 1 r giving him 52 hr and 114 rbi matt cain finished his career on a strong note despite taking a no decision as he tossed 50 shutout innings allowing 2 h and 1 bb striking out 4 over 50 ip against the padres clayton kershaws final tune up was unimpressive allowing 3 er on 7 h over 40 ip in colorado what else happened on the field that we need to know about lets take a look
1 lance mccullers struggles in his final start
taking on the red sox in boston he allowed 5 er on 6 h and 2 bb striking out 6 over 41 ip while its easy to see the upside potential 2017 has to be considered a disappointment for mcculllers as hes battled injury and ended the season with a 425 era and 130 whip of course he also entered the day with a 616 groundball rate 992 k9 and 299 bb9 over 1141 ip showing that he has the potential to be a fantasy ace if it all comes together a 325 babip and 693 strand rate dragged down the numbers and given the injuries its possible that he gets viewed as a bullpen arm time will tell but at this point view him as a potential james paxton type breakout candidate come 2018
2 no one is going to argue the power of kyle schwarber
he went 24 with 1 hr 4 rbi and 1 r yesterday giving him 30 hr and 69 rbi in 421 ab on the season besides where he ultimately fits defensively the other issue is his 211 average and the problems are twofold first is the obvious as he entered the day with a 310 strikeout rate courtesy of a 123 swstr the other is that he appears to be swinging for the fences a bit with a 155 line drive rate 464 fly ball rate and 163 popup rate elevated strikeouts and popups especially for a player with little speed is going to mean little upside in his average if you need power theres value but you need to be cautious outside of that
3 luke weaver ends on a bad note
taking on the brewers he allowed 6 er on 9 h and 4 bb striking out 4 over 42 ip with the big blow coming courtesy of domingo santana 35 1 hr 2 rbi 1 r it was backtoback poor showings allowing 14 er over 72 ip nearly wiping out all of the good that he had shown prior to this his era ballooned from 205 to 388 the problem was a sudden home run binge 3 hr allowed in these two starts though he entered yesterday showing an ability to generate groundballs 518 though that could regress a little bit given his 444 mark at triplea couple that with strikeouts and control and theres obviously still reason to believe dont let two poor starts change that
4 an acelike performance for jameson taillon
obviously the nationals were resting some of their starters as many teams are these days but it was still an impressive showing for taillon who allowed 1 er on 4 h and 1 bb striking out 5 over 70 ip there was a bit of luck as he didnt allow a home run despite generating 5 groundballs vs 11 fly balls on the day of course that also hasnt been the story of his seasoncareer entering the day with a 479 groundball rate 499 in 2302 ip in the majors couple that with solid strikeouts 853 k9 and control 320 bb9 and its easy to get excited over his longterm appeal dont let his 444 era distract you from the actual upside
5 maikel franco trying to earn 18 starting role
he went 15 with 1 hr 1 rbi and 1 r yesterday giving him home runs in three of his last four games while he does have 23 hr on the season hes also hit just 230 and its not due to contact issues in the least 150 strikeout rate entering the day its obvious that a 237 babip is the issue and while wed expect a better mark his 182 line drive rate and 160 popup rate compared to marks of 200 and 171 in 16 doesnt offer much potential as is you can argue that hes more of a 250ish hitter and nothing more and theres the chance that he loses significant playing time next season hell be a posthype flier but not a player to depend on
6 is carson fulmer backing up the hype
he defeated the indians in his final start of 17 allowing 1 er on 3 h and 2 bb striking out 2 over 50 ip in 231 ip in the majors he posted a 386 era and 124 whip though 19 k vs 13 bb isnt an inspiring ratio he struggled in both categories at triplea prior to his recall with a 686 k9 and 464 bb9 and his 93 swstr and 267 oswing entering the day 6 swinging strikes yesterday doesnt offer much hope for a breakout theres talent and theres going to be hype but hes a backend option at best
7 a disappointing finish for lucas sims
taking on the marlins he allowed 6 r on 7 h and 4 bb striking out 1 over 20 ip against the marlins the youngster entered the majors carrying the risk of home runs 342 groundball rate at triplea but hes also struggled to generate many swings and misses against mlb hitters he entered the day with an 84 swstr and 284 oswing maybe he figures it out with more experience but for now hes going to be a hands off proposition until he proves otherwise
8 is there any value in jake junis moving forward
he ended on a high note allowing 2 r on 5 h and 2 bb striking out 5 over 60 ip against the diamondbacks to finish with a 430 era and 128 whip over 981 ip in the majors he didnt show much in the strikeout department in the majors with a 732 k9 courtesy of an 89 swstr while he showed more at triplea this season 1090 k9 that was a bit of an aberration 885 k9 at doublea in 16 throw in only pedestrian groundball rates and there isnt a significant amount of upside he would appear to be more of a backend optionstreamer depending on the situation and matchup but its hard to envision him ultimately becoming much more than that
9 marcus semien is finally finding his power stroke
there was a lot of upside entering the season but his early season injury zapped a lot of the hype and potential he finally appears to have it all behind him of course maybe too little too late though it again gives us the same type of hope heading into 18 he went 25 with 1 hr 1 rbi and 1 r yesterday giving him 4 hr in his past 10 games hes still struggling with his average hitting 249 and that could be the type of player that he is bringing both power and speed 10 hr12 sb a 250 hitter is more than enough and look for him to be a buy low option heading into next season
10 mitch haniger continues making up for lost time
he went 55 with 1 r yesterday including 3 doubles and is hitting 365 with 7 hr as well as 8 doubles and 1 triple 14 rbi and 17 r in september injuries have dragged down the overall numbers but hes still hitting 285 with 16 hr over 365 ab this season if you project that out over a full 550 ab you get the exact player we were expecting with nothing unrealistic behind it 331 babip 160 hrfb while its hard to imagine much of a posthype sleeper heading into 18 if his value drops at all due to the face value numbers there is going to be appeal

he spent three days in intensive care where his condition was stabilised before being offered the option to return to the uk for surgery or to have the procedure in south africa
initially i wanted to go back home to be with my family but i was advised that statistically it the survival rate was better not to delay said kerry whos wife was flown out to be with him before the procedure
he did manage a video call to his children who were four and six at the time back in the uk but said trying to make it a positive environment for them was one of the hardest moments of his life
it was really tough because youre putting on a very brave face for them and trying to smile and laugh when youre not feeling like it so much he said
five days after being admitted to hospital kerry was fitted with three metal stents in his heart but he began impressing the doctors from the moment he woke who were astounded by his rapid recovery
i was a bit of a freak show in the cardiac care unit in johannesburg as they kept coming and checking on this young guy who looks on the surface really healthy said the bishambased coach
the consultant told me youre as fit as a fiddle youve come through this really well so the whole situation seemed as much of a shock to them as it was to me
to further boost his morale several of the gb team were allowed to visit him in hospital before he returned to the uk
while kerry had been criticised for his grumpy attitude towards the british players during the 2008 beijing olympics he had taken on board the harrowing feedback and over the following eight years become a muchloved coach
it was a brilliant moment because i wasnt a hockey coach anymore it was just people looking out for one another said kerry who guided the gb women to their first hockey gold at rio 2016
olympic champion susannah townsend was part of the british squad competing in south africa but was unable to attend the hospital as she was suffering from a cold and wanted to minimise the risk of kerry developing illness
ive known him for 13 years so it was a real shock for us all and really difficult for me personally said the player after the team finished third at the world league semifinals
danny didnt want his situation to be a distraction during the event and he didnt want us to win for him but it was in the back of our minds
the new danny kerry
kerry changed his diet after his surgery with the help of kate richardsonwalsh
why the relatively fit and regular cyclist kerry suffered a heart attack is still relatively unclear but the coach has attempted to transform some elements of his life to minimise the stresses which potentially played a role in the condition
the health service here have been brilliant but are still a bit bemused because my risk factor for something like this is incredible low said kerry who has lost more than 6kg since surgery
ive had time to reflect on my life and work over the last couple of months and im now incredibly fastidious about what i eat i dont touch anything with any saturated fat in it at all
olympic gold medalwinning hockey captain kate richardsonwalsh who retired after the teams historic gold in rio helped facilitate that change with a special delivery for kerry
i managed to get a whole package of quorn sent to him to make sure he was eating healthily said richardsonwalsh who describes learning of kerrys heart attack as horrendous
he would go out on runs during tournaments so he was relatively fit but hes lost so much weight now and his diet has really changed so hopefully he can look after his physical and mental wellbeing going forwards
kerrys children anna and orla have provided some light relief during his rehabilitation and transition into his new life
kerrys children anna and orla have provided some light relief during his rehabilitation and transition into his new life
they know that im very diligent about what i eat now so theyll be eating sausages and ill be looking on enviously and my sevenyearold anna goes sorry daddy but i like sausages and i know you cant eat them so there are funny moments he said
another time my fouryearold orla was lying on my chest giving me a cuddle and then jumps off laughs and runs to the kitchen and goes mummy mummy daddys heart isnt beating properly
it was kind of funny and then not funny at the same time
enjoying family time is something kerry says he now cherishes and appreciates much more
i spent my entire life looking backwards and looking forwards never living in the moment he says when referring to how he hardly celebrated gold in rio before contemplating a new challenge for the squad
i look back at how ive been out for nice meals with friends and family and on the surface it may look like ive been present but in my head im thinking about things that have happened in games and about what im going to do next
i needed to change elements of that and make my life a bit more healthy
why continue
gb women won a first olympic hockey gold medal at rio 2016 beating the netherlands 20 in a penalty shootout
after achieving the sports ultimate prize of olympic gold on top of previous european commonwealth and world league honours kerry could have been forgiven from walking away from the sport to focus on his health
however he is arguably more determined than ever to continue making history with the gb womens hockey team
its really hard for some people to get their head around but it isnt a job says kerry who has transformed the fortunes of the squad since taking over in 2005
yes you take a salary home but thats not the reason you do it its because of youre passionate about it and are surrounded by staff and athletes who want the best as well
it may be fewer than three months since his surgery but after working two days per week for the past month kerry has now returned to fulltime coaching with the gb team
the squad are about to head into their busiest period outside of the olympic year with the world league finals in new zealand in november followed by the gold coast commonwealth games in australia in april
the gb women will then return to the scene of their 2012 olympic bronze medalwinning success as london hosts the world cup from next july
does more history beckon in tokyo
kerry takes daily medication to keep the metalwork in his heart incheck while he hopes cycling frequently as well as yoga and meditation will help reduce the stresses at future events
having missed the teams european bronze campaign in august while recovering from surgery kerry is eager to return to a competitive tournament environment and believes his newlook squad have amazing potential
for me personally the next challenge after winning a olympic gold medal is to do something even more special and achieve it again says kerry who will have regular health checkups in the years ahead
i have a really great life and a great opportunity to try for the even bigger challenge of winning again"

crunch time begins now for fantasy owners everywhere as we have reached the dreaded bye weeks the real ones not those makeshift disasters that may or may not have put tampa and miami at disadvantages for the remainder of the season but i digress week 4 provided another laundry list of unexpected results across the league both in game scores and fantasy outputs so where does that leave us this season in terms of thinking we have a good grip on how week 5 will go we have no clue but heres some rankings anyway quarterback by all accounts thursday night is shaping up to be an all out points extravaganza between new england and tampa bay placing both brady and winston in this weeks top 3 plays how bad has new englands defense been this year 27th in pass rush and their shiny new toy in stephon gilmore has not been as advertised deshaun watson makes the biggest jump of the group and is starting to look like the real deal hard to imagine deandre hopkins isnt loving his new quarterback by now i like philip rivers this week to get the chargers into the win column for the first time this season but past that there arent a lot of deep sleeper options compared to last weeks crop

"__label__real artificial intelligence ai has become a key driving force for next generation innovation research has shown various examples of successful problem solving and the advent of highperformance computing power has led to ai being used in a wide spectrum of applications there are already many commercial applications of ai and many corporates are competing with one another to own related ip initiatives
english mathematician alan turing first introduced the concept of machine intelligence in 1950 since then the theoretical perspective of ai had been actively researched in mathematics logic cognitive science and life science to name a few the advent of computing technology in the late 1990s helped the field of ai to leapfrog in research and demonstrated the possibility for various applications
figure 1 shows the research landscape of artificial intelligence spanning multiple research areas including recognition such as data classification or pattern recognition diagnosis of abnormality natural language processing autonomous driving articifial life and algorithm research the analysis is based on the top 15000 highly cited papers of ai research indexed in the web of science for the past 10 years
many countries are actively conducting ai research early research was largely led by the us but china has been prolific in published research since 2000 in asia pacific japan korea and australia are also actively conducting ai research
in ai machine learning has demonstrated strong business cases to enhance system intelligence machine learning involves computer preprocessing of input data about the target environment and recognition of key characteristics of a given dataset since recognizing the environment before making a decision is a basic trait of intelligence machine learning can be used in a variety of applications figure 3 shows technology category analysis of machine learning patents spanning not just computer algorithms but also automobile medicine and biotechnology this shows that machine learning is the driving force of technology innovation in many industries
there are still many research areas where we can use and improve ai to solve actual complex problems that we face today although a great deal of research has been conducted by research institutions and universities corporates continue to own a massive volume of patents on artificial intelligence the most ideal scenario would be to position the research community as the collaborator for corporates rather than as their competitor as ai will play a critical role in technology innovation research institutions should also place more emphasis on filing patent applications related to artificial intelligence

"__label__real washington cnn president donald trump scorned by reports that rex tillerson called him a moron earlier this year told forbes in an interview released tuesday that he has a higher iq than his secretary of state
the comment underscores the volatility between the two men after multiple reports that their relationship has frayed over the secretary of states comment trump and tillerson along with secretary of defense james mattis will have lunch together at the white house on tuesday afternoon
i think its fake news but if he did that i guess well have to compare iq tests trump said and i can tell you who is going to win
tuesday afternoon white house press secretary sarah sanders said trumps comment was simply a joke
the president certainly never implied that the secretary of state was not incredibly intelligent she said he made a joke nothing more than that
she added he has full confidence in the secretary of state
state department spokesperson heather nauert said tillersons iq is high
responding to a reporters question in jest apropos of nothing whats the secretarys iq
its high nauert replied anyone who can put things together you know and is an engineer its high
nauert added that trump asserted his confidence in tillerson publicly she added that they have a strong relationship
hes allowed to have a sense of humor she said of the iq comment
trump was aware before the report earlier this month that tillerson had referred to him as a moron at the pentagon this summer a source familiar with the conversation told cnn but its unclear whether trump discussed the remark with tillerson trump was not present at the pentagon meeting where the comment was made
trump and his administration have looked to discredit the initial nbc report despite the fact that other outlets have since confirmed tillerson made the comment
the nbcnews story has just been totally refuted by sec tillerson and vp pence it is fakenews trump tweeted at the time they should issue an apology to america
tillerson also made an inperson statement lauding his boss and his commitment to working for him but sources have told cnn that the two men have an uneasy relationship that has recently been highlighted by the fact that trump publicly tweeted that tillerson was wasting his time trying to negotiate with north korea
the president doubled down on those comments in his interview with forbes
he was wasting his time trump said im not undermining him i think im actually strengthening authority
just watched corker tillerson not getting support he needs replay more videos must watch corker tillerson not getting support he needs 0130
though the uneasy relationship continues it is unlikely for now that tillerson will leave sources have told cnn because the president and his top aides are aware of the perception that they are shedding top staff at an unnerving clip tom price trumps first health and human services secretary resigned in late september over a private plane scandal and since becoming president trump has dismissed several top communication aides a chief of staff and a chief strategist
trump has repeatedly stepped out onto the foreign stage since becoming president but the forays have not been universally well received trump who ran on the promise to put america first has largely thrown out the foreign policy playbook of past administrations and in his interview with forbes trump said he is unlikely to fill the state department with his own people
im generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally bebecause you dont need them the president said i mean you look at some of these agencies how massive they are and its totally unnecessary
he added they have hundreds of thousands of people"

this was a big weekend for kesen one of the many communities in japan that were devastated after an earthquake and tsunami struck in march 2011
kesen reopened its buddhist temple on sunday a times photo editor who often chooses the images for our briefings hiroko masuike was there to capture the moment
ms masuike has been making twiceyearly visits to document residents struggles to rebuild their lives since the disaster which killed almost 16000 people and caused nuclear plant meltdowns
in one of the communitys villages the tsunami killed more than 200 people and reduced most buildings to rubble
the disasters scars are still visible ms masuike said most residents have moved away and only about 10 buildings have been rebuilt

"__label__real in cameroon the military has been deployed in englishspeaking areas where the government blocked social media websites for at least the second time this year
security forces have been accused of killing protesters in both areas and neither nations government has engaged in meaningful dialogue with residents who want to form their own country
but the harsh responses are only fueling the separatist movements potentially intensifying calls to break apart the nations analysts say the excluded are fighting back in the language of exclusion and its not pretty said chidi odinkalu a former chairman of the national human rights commission in nigeria the way out is to run an inclusive country its doable
hostilities with the central government in nigerias southeast have simmered ever since the nigerian civil war started 50 years ago when a selfdeclared republic of biafra tried to break off from the rest of the nation tensions have continued in the decades since the rebellion and picked up momentum this year

as the country wondered about the health of mr buhari who has spent more than 100 days in london receiving medical treatment for a mystery illness people poured into the streets in the southeast to support a movement to create a new state or break off into a separate nation as the area tried to do in the late 1960s
last month the military deployed tanks and helicopters in the region separatists say that their supporters have been killed and tortured by the military
troops encircled the home of the leader of the indigenous people of biafra nnamdi kanu and his supporters tried to fight them off with sticks reuters reported that bullet holes were found in the house and that two of its journalists saw six bulletriddled bodies in the morgue separatists said the six people were killed during what they said was a raid by troops on mr kanus home the whereabouts of mr kanu is unknown

nigerias unity is settled and not negotiable he said we shall not allow irresponsible elements to start trouble and when things get bad they run away and saddle others with the responsibility of bringing back order if necessary with their blood
besides the secessionist movement in nigeria the country is also engaged in a war with boko haram in the northeast while also grappling with battles between farmers and herdsmen
this ought to be the preoccupation of the nigerian army at this point of our historical annals said sylvester odion akhaine an associate professor of political science at lagos state university referring to the other conflicts
in cameroon protests started nearly a year ago when english speakers in the northwest and southwest began demanding an end to what they say is discrimination by the frenchspeaking majority

lawyers fed up with new laws that were never translated into english started speaking out they complained that the government sent judges who could not speak english well to fill their courthouses they were soon joined by teachers professors and other citizens who closed shops and schools to protest against a government that they say has failed to live up to its constitutional requirement for a bilingual nation
protests continued through most of this year numerous demonstrators were jailed and officials shut down the internet at least two protesters were killed when the security forces fired live ammunition at rallies many children in englishspeaking regions have not been in school for the past 11 months

through the months of agitation and with cameroonians abroad organizing protests a small separatist movement began to gain momentum its supporters are now calling for a new nation that they want to be called ambazonia
more violence broke out last month when three police officers were wounded by an improvised bomb the attack has drawn the ire of government officials whose support comes from frenchspeaking areas cameroons communications minister compared secessionists to the islamist terrorist group boko haram
on oct 1 officials sent soldiers and military helicopters to demonstrations in englishspeaking regions where protesters were calling for independence supporters of ambazonia hoisted their flags in several villages the government issued a curfew and travel restrictions
amnesty international said it confirmed 17 deaths in the protests with some of the victims reported to have been shot by soldiers john fru ndi the chairman of an opposition party that has the support of many englishspeaking people in the country estimated that as many as 30 people were killed news media outlets also reported the deaths of security officers last week the state department said in a statement that the cameroonian governments use of force to restrict free expression and peaceful assembly and violence by protestors was unacceptable
the demonstrations in cameroon took place on the anniversary of the englishspeaking regions independence more than 50 years ago for four decades cameroon was split into english and french territories in 1961 the territories then unified into one republic made up mostly of french speakers as well as an englishspeaking minority that adhered to british common law english speakers have long complained that they get fewer resources from the government than their french counterparts do
mr ndi said he had repeatedly called on president paul biya to travel to the englishspeaking parts of the country to open a dialogue with secessionists but that has not happened mr ndi said though the government did free some leaders of the movement who had been jailed protesters say that others are still are being unjustly imprisoned
mr biya in office since 1982 has made it clear that he does not support any split of the nation he has been spending time recently in switzerland where he often goes for vacations but on oct 1 he released a statement on facebook calling for peaceful dialogue
let me make this very clear it is not forbidden to voice any concerns in the republic he said on his official page however nothing great can be achieved by using verbal excesses street violence and defying authority"

dean pees hasnt been much better after two weeks the ravens were drawing comparisons to their historic 2000 defense after four weeks the ravens ranks 21st overall in total defense they let a jaguars team that lost to the jets yesterday hang 44 points on them on an international stage last week the jets have been pegged as one of the worst teams in football by the way
so here we go again fire pees and fire whoever happens to be calling plays at the moment right its a valid point but the bigger question is why are they both even still here to begin with
after last season most fans and media assumed john harbaugh would make some changes at the very least on offense after morhinweg took over for marc trestman in the middle of last year the offense didnt improve at the time morhinweg was viewed as a stopgap solution until 2017 when harbaugh would find the right play caller who could get more out of joe flacco
instead he stuck with the same crew he brought back his old buddy marty and somehow we should be surprised that were seeing a similar result a lethargic and stale offense that resembles play calls youd see at calvert hall not the nfl
so if pees needs to go and marty needs to go than harbaugh needs to go as well it was ultimately his decision to keep them both around so he should be held accountable when they predictably produce the exact same result the panic button shouldnt be pressed because the ravens have lost two straight games it should be pressed because of how theyve lost them they were embarrassed by a perennial loser that lost to the jets yesterday and then embarrassed at home against their biggest rival with first place on the line
now i know what some will say the ravens are decimated with injuries and its not harbaughs fault but the problems on offense go deeper than the rash of banged up players the play calls are predictable the team looks slow and lethargic and flacco continues to regress
some will say you cant blame the coaches and at some point it comes down to players executing the plays if thats your logic than what do we even have coaches for its their job to get the most they can out of players and this staff isnt accomplishing that
how many years in a row can excuses be made for subpar seasons if its not the injuries then its flaccos rust after recovering from knee surgery if its not flaccos knee its a lack of playmakers if its not the playmakers its playing abroad
tony lombardi has floated a theory out there before that harbaugh hires older coaches past their prime who wont threaten his job security hes stayed away from the kyle shanahans and adam gases of the world its an idea that looks more and more valid with each passing season
as long as its allowed to continue expect more of the same from this team
a lot of excuses and more embarrassing losses like weve witnessed the last two weeks

reuters rafael nadal continued to scythe his way through the shanghai masters on thursday reaching the quarterfinals with a 63 61 thrashing of temperamental italian fabio fognini
the spaniard needed two minutes over the hour to dispatch fognini taking his winning streak to 14 matches since the start of the us open where he claimed a 16th grand slam title
the 31yearold is closing in on finishing the year as world number one for the first time since 2013 but roger federer the only man who can stop him is looking equally impressive
federer delighted his small army of chinese fans inside the qi zhong centre with an emphatic 64 62 defeat of tricky ukrainian alexandr dolgopolov
fognini was playing the day after being handed a suspended ban from two grand slams and 96000 fine for verbally abusing a female umpire at the us open
but there was little fight from the 30yearold as nadal lost only six points on serve in the opening set

before its news
the tenure of dave doeren has been an interesting one at nc state he was brought in to win games and in his first 4 seasons it was looking rocky he was not beating teams that he should have last year ecu bc are just 2 of those examples the fan base was becoming very restless in raleigh
the complaints were many and wide ranging there was the dismissal of offensive coordinator matt canada there was he lacked personality and then there was the no signature wins no wins against teams that he had less talent than that all ended on saturday with the wolfpacks victory against florida state now people will say that the reason that nc state won is because fsu lost deonndre francois others will say it was because of the refs and some questionable calls yes there were some
still others will say it was because of the 2 week layoff that the seminoles had because of hurricane irma this is the only one ill give you through all of this dave doerens team came out and did what it needed to do the wolfpack defensive line was dominant making life hell for fsus true freshman quaterback the offense was balanced rushing the ball 37 times and passing 33 times
dave doeren has been working on all of the things that critics have been throwing at him if you watched him on the coaches room during the national championship game last season you saw the personality come out he was funny and engaging dave doeren needed this game against fsu
he won against a team that will be a top 25 team at the end of the season now all he has to do is not allow this team to rest on this win and continue carrying on that intensity that they took to doak campbell stadium this past saturday

"__label__real cnn im often asked when couples should consider therapy its common for one partner to be unhappy feel disconnected or feel that their needs for intimacy arent being met
but rather than communicate about it that partner may open up a metaphorical window with someone else and begin an affair by the time the couple comes to therapy the affair itself becomes the main topic and its underlying causes are often ignored
the same scenario rings true for other sources of contention from financial disagreements to sexual concerns its clear that couples shouldnt wait until theyre in crisis mode to come to therapy but what should they do
when is the right time to see a therapist
couples should seek therapy long before they think they need to most experts believe that therapy can be an important part of your relationship most issues within a couple start small and then grow in size when they dont get resolved this is where therapy can help by giving tools and techniques to improve conflict resolution explained kristie overstreet a licensed mental health counselor the majority of couples that i work with say that they should have started therapy years earlier
there are three sides to every story his side her side and the truth psychotherapist kimberly resnick anderson agreed an objective third party can be just the ticket when couples feel they can no longer communicate effectively
rather than viewing therapy as the solution to a crisis look at it as an integral aspect of a healthy life suggested ashley n grinonneaudenton marriage and family therapist
every couple should take preventive measures to maintain health in their relationship just like going to the gym she said if couples dont work their relational and emotional muscles they become untoned weak and create more of a chance of damage being done to their relationship
what happens during couples therapy
although every therapist is different there are some commonalities the first session typically involves the therapist getting to know you discussing the areas of the relationship they hope to improve and setting goals
some but not all therapists will assign homework for the couples to work on before the next session ideally most of the work gets done in my experience outside of my office psychotherapist samantha manewitz said
what problems can benefit from therapy
couples come to therapy for any number of reasons but in my experience in addition to infidelity the greatest issues include sex communication money and major life changes such as getting married or starting a family couples therapy is also a good idea if one of you is coping with an issue that might be affecting your relationship such as depression or simply if youre feeling stuck and stagnant in your relationship
therapy can provide a safe space to talk about sensitive topics such as sex just like folks can get caught in a negative relational cycle couples can often also get stuck in a negative sexual cycle said michael moran a certified sex therapist i tell couples that when the sex theyre having is worth having theyll have more of it and so we need to explore what blocks exist to creating that place between them
communication is also a big concern for couples but simply talking with each other more isnt the answer there is communication and then theres effective communication explained sara nasserzadeh a psychologist both parties need to feel heard soothed respected and cared for first we analyze old communication patterns and then replace them with feasible and more effective ones these are all worked out collaboratively with the couple and within the context of their everyday life
you might also consider couples therapy to help support you at times of major life change and transition getting married becoming parents for the first time moving changing jobs losing jobs becoming emptynesters coping after extramarital affairs recovering from addiction caring for aging parents all of these transitions can destabilize a couples equilibrium anderson said therapy affords couples an opportunity to negotiate these transitions with as little disruption as possible and to explore and honor what a particular transition means to each partner
and dont discount the value of couples therapy in helping you and your partner dig yourselves out of a rut
therapy allows couples to talk through their feelings and articulate how their relationship may not be meeting their expectations said james c wadley a licensed counselor more often than not there is some common ground that may have enabled them to be in the relationship feeling stuck can shift if both parties are willing to compromise in a way so that individual needs are met
what if one partner refuses to go
this is a fairly common scenario in couples therapy how you approach it can make a difference talk with your partner extensively about why youre feeling youd like to get into couples therapy moran said dont just spring it on them and insist they go
if theyre still hesitant remember that you can attend therapy on your own this alone may have a beneficial effect
instead of waiting for the other person who doesnt want to go to therapy to change therapy can help strengthen your own selfimprovement and personal growth said marissa nelson a marriage and family therapist the hesitant partner may become impressed by these positive changes and decide to pursue therapy after all
if you think your own experiences with therapy have piqued your partners curiosity let them know that can see the therapist individually as well often by letting them know a safety zone will be created where their voice is heard and fault or blame isnt the goal the hesitant partner might feel safe to come in psychotherapist constance delgiudice explained
how do you know if your therapist is a good fit
it helps to do your research before choosing a couples therapist but the truth is that you wont really know whether theyre the right for you and your partner until you get together
join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter
i often arrange a phone call first with clients to make sure we are potentially a good fit nasserzadeh said once you meet pay attention to the therapists communication style the rational behind their questions and their general approach any homework they assign should be explained clearly and makes sense to you and your line of logic
how long should therapy last
theres no onesizefitsall answer to this question it really depends on the couple and the issues theyre working through for some couples a few sessions may be all they need to jumpstart their relationship while others may remain in therapy for years
in general its a good idea to see a therapist together until youve met your goals and feel confident that youve gained the skills necessary to navigate the ups and downs of your relationship"

when a police shooting occurs people often argue that the officer involved should have used a taser as a less lethal optionbut some of the main points that are rarely discussed are how often police misuse tasers and how many victims die as a result
an investigation conducted by reuters revealed that more than 1000 people have died as victims of police tasers since 2000 not only did the investigation find that tasers have a lethal power that is not being recognized by the company that manufactures the weapons or by the departments that issue them it also discovered that many of the victims are suffering from mental health problems
in the most detailed study ever of fatalities and litigation involving police use of stun guns reuters finds more than 150 autopsy reports citing tasers as a cause or contributor to deaths across america behind the fatalities is a sobering reality many who die are among societys vulnerableunarmed in psychological distress and seeking help
in one example police in ontario california were called to address a disturbance at a home involving an unarmed man with mental health issues three officers arrived and instead of taking the 57yearold man to the hospital as his wife requested a veteran officer hit the man with a taser twiceonce directly to the chestand the man died as a result reuters noted that this is not an isolated incident
ken wallentine former chief of law enforcement for the utah attorney general told reuters that cops have been turned into mental health workers on the street and he fears that some police training and some police practices have allowed the crowding out of persuasion and the taser has become the default tool
according to the american psychiatric association 1 in every 100 police calls involves a person with a mental health disorder and as the investigation found police officers often do not have the proper training to calm the situation so they resort to using a taser on the subject which can have detrimental or even fatal consequences
peter eisler one of the reporters conducting the investigation told pbs newshour that his team was surprised to find that there were more deaths from police tasers there was more litigation surrounding the incidents and there was a more significant financial burden on the public than they had expected
the weapons themselves are not regulated not as theyre sold to police eisler said you know theyre not a medical device theyre not regulated by the fda theyre not a consumer product so theyre not regulated by the consumer product safety commission so taser itself has done a lot of thedid a lot of the early testing on these devices and one of the things that we found was that those tests were not necessarily as thorough or as solid as taser may have led police to believe
eisler noted that as time went on and more research was conducted it was discovered that the taser has the ability to change the rhythm of the heart in a way that could lead to a fatal cardiac arrest
the firearms survival guide ad taser says that these weapons have been studied and that theyre overwhelmingly safe tasers position is that the risks to the heart are more theoretical the company does not concede that there has ever been a death direct a cardiacrelated death directly attributable to a taser what we did was we looked at as many autopsy reports as we could collect on the 1000plus cases we identified and we ended up getting around 750 autopsies and we found that in at least 150plus of those autopsies the medical examiner the coroner attributed the death either in whole or in part to the taser or listed the taser as a contributing factor to that death
as this investigation reveals that police are killing an alarming number of people with tasers and that many of those victims suffer from mental health issues it serves as a reminder that there needs to be an overhaul in the way police are trained to deal with the citizens they claim to serveespecially those citizens who have mental health disorders and are often targeted and abused by the law enforcement officers they are taught to trust

"__label__real the red sox could have said the same thing in 2009 when they lost twice in the bestoffive division round in anaheim then returned home to be swept by the angels it happened again last fall against the cleveland indians two road losses then a seasonending dud at fenway
if the red sox lose on sunday they will have finished eight of their last nine seasons without a single playoff victory the shining exception of course was 2013 when they won the world series just two players from this postseason roster pedroia and shortstop xander bogaerts were also on that one
i dont think rosterwise we probably had the best team going into that postseason bogaerts said i know a lot of people didnt pick us but in the end we did it we did it as a team
he added that those red sox faced a twogamestoone world series deficit in st louis but rallied to win the next three

that was one of the hardest things to overcome and we did it bogaerts said its nothing that big like that time
so much has changed in just four years especially with bostons offense those red sox led the majors in onbase plus slugging percentage these red sox finished 22nd in ops at 736 far below even the sad and broken mets the nine other playoff teams held the top nine spots in that statistic
the old boston standby david ortiz now yuks it up with arod on foxs postseason studio show their red sox cleanup man betts gamely presses on with a wrist that recently needed a cortisone shot it bothered betts when he batted in the eighth inning on friday and he left for a defensive replacement

everything will be all right he said referring to the wrist not the teams chances those hinge largely on doug fister the journeyman righthander who lost to the astros last friday fister has a strong playoff track record but his earned run average was 488 this season the red sox plucked him off the roster of the class aaa salt lake bees an angels affiliate in june

they spent far more for their other starters they traded gems from their farm system in deals for sale and pomeranz in 2014 they traded the october stalwart jon lester to oakland for yoenis cespedes then flipped cespedes to detroit for rick porcello they signed david price in free agency for seven years and 217 million
so where do they stand now sale and pomeranz neither of whom had ever started in the playoffs before combined to allow 11 runs and 14 hits in seven innings against the astros price and porcello have pitched in relief price because elbow trouble limits his workload and porcello because his rough season 1117 465 has knocked him from the rotations top three
these games have gone so miserably that craig kimbrel the allstar closer who strikes out nearly half of all hitters was reduced to mopup duty on friday just to stay sharp he held the deficit at seven with a scoreless eighth inning
the red sox scored in the top of the ninth but thankfully nobody cited that as a show of character or a willingness to fight to the end it would have rung hollow anyway because the facts are clear the red sox have had a nice season with another al east title but their hitters cannot keep up with the astros and their pitchers cannot stop them
every single game 1 through 9 everybody can do damage everybody can go deep said houstons carlos correa whose firstinning homer started the party on friday theres no holes in our lineup
and there are just too many holes in the red sox"
"__label__real the speech highlighted the problems confronting mrs may her battle to complete it seemed to some like a metaphor the set of mishaps overshadowing the messages she hoped would dominate the news
the conservative party conference in manchester was the first since mrs may gambled by calling a general election in june a political blunder that cost her party its majority an unexpectedly strong performance from the opposition labour party destroyed much of her authority in the process
under the leftwing leadership of jeremy corbyn labours antiausterity message struck a chord particularly with younger voters who turned out in greater numbers than usual leaving many conservative activists in manchester wondering how to compete
as the debate about the conservative partys future has unfolded at the conference center and beyond mrs mays potential successors have exploited a chance to grab the limelight
none took that opportunity more ruthlessly than the foreign secretary boris johnson who has made two interventions undermining mrs mays strategy for negotiating britains withdrawal from the european union known as brexit
video
mr johnson created a contretemps as well telling a conference panel that the libyan coastal city of surt a former redoubt of the islamic state terrorist group could be the next dubai if the authorities could just clear the dead bodies away critics including some members of the party said he should resign
while there seems to be no immediate plot to unseat mrs may analysts say that the longest she can expect to remain in her job is until march 2019 when the withdrawal is to take place the party conference and this speech in particular was an opportunity to reassert her authority over a cabinet squabbling over the details of brexit
advertisement continue reading the main story
that was not how it turned out before the speech most people would have bet on her coming out of the conference season alive although the sharks were already circling said tim bale professor of politics at queen mary university of london referring to potential rivals for mrs mays job
the speech has put blood in the water he said
on wednesday mrs may promised that more affordable homes would be built to address the countrys housing crisis she detailed a cap on energy prices and promised to create a british version of the american dream
she also apologized to conservative party members for having led an election campaign that was too scripted too presidential and spoke only briefly about the divisive issue of brexit
but mrs may was soon interrupted by a prankster from the audience who handed her a p45 a form sent to britons as they leave a job saying boris asked me to give you this guards ejected him from the hall
though the episode raised some security questions the police later said that the man simon brodkin a comedian had accreditation to attend the conference that was despite the fact mr brodkin performs as a character called lee nelson whose website mentions pranks including disrupting a news conference by throwing bank notes at sepp blatter the former president of fifa the governing body of international soccer
mrs mays colleagues put their best gloss on events arguing that her performance had illustrated her determination and that voters would understand and sympathize with her predicament
jeremy hunt the health secretary described it as the ultimate tough gig but said that she battled on and that what the public will take away from that curiously is that sense of duty
nevertheless others expected frustration among mrs mays allies that a speech that had been going well until the interruption spiraled out of control overshadowing announcements that had sought to wrest attention from mr corbyns agenda
photo
the biggest of those was the pledge to place limits on energy prices though there was no detail on how many people it would affect some critics complained that the idea conflicted with mrs mays broader defense of the freemarket economy which the conservatives say is threatened by mr corbyn
advertisement continue reading the main story
for mrs mays supporters who watch clips of the speech on television news her throaty delivery may not be as grating as it was for the audience who heard its entirety
certainly there was support from activists outside the hall including one party member joe porter who said that mrs mays determination to finish her speech illustrated her professionalism adding we are all human beings we all get coughs
another party member enoch manto lieu said that the episode might help humanize mrs may who has been mocked by critics as maybot a reference to her robotic scripted answers to questions
for her part mrs may sought to show some selfdeprecating humor by posting a photo of throat medication on twitter
there was empathy from some fellow politicians including nicola sturgeon scotlands first minister whose scottish national party holds its conference beginning sunday
professor bale said that it was possible that should mrs may keep her job for longer than expected she might manage to revive her image as mr corbyn did after struggling for a significant time after he won his partys leadership professor bale added however that he thought it was too late for mrs may
for the conservative politicians who worry about her ability to lead their party to victory against labour the prime ministers speech may have confirmed their doubts

andrew neil a broadcaster and veteran political observer wrote on twitter that the many tories who firmly believe mrs may should never be allowed to fight another election will be immutable on the matter

fiftyyearold ghodbane his tanned face etched with deep lines has been herding sheep for 20 years having inherited the job and land from his father but in this dry region worsening cycles of drought are posing new challenges to an old profession
according to a report algeria developed as part of its contribution to the 2015 paris agreement on climate change action average annual rainfall in the country has fallen by more than 30 percent in recent decades
the country is also facing higher temperatures summer heat has soared in batna province in northeast algeria climbing from a maximum temperature of about 100 degrees fahrenheit in 1990 to more than 107 degrees fahrenheit 41 degrees celsius in 2017
for ghodbane that means his land now lacks enough fodder for his flock in drier seasons so he must purchase extra feed at added expense
in addition to selling his sheep for meat he used to earn profits by selling animals to other herders expanding their flocks
those sales have stopped as worsening heat and drought make herding less viable and ghodbane has had to limit the size of his own flock due to the increasing costs of caring for them
drought stops everything he said
the solution to his falling income is simple rain thats it he said
less water more heat
algeria is not a big emitter of climatechanging gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide but warming driven by emissions from around the world is having big impacts here including more extreme weather conditions
you dont have to be a source of emissions to be affected noted adel hanna a climate modeling expert at the institute for the environment at the university of north carolina at chapel hill thats why we call it a global effect
hanna who is from egypt said that the two biggest climate worries for north africa water scarcity and higher temperatures are feeding off each other with limited rainfall rapidly evaporating from the soil in higher temperatures
the net effect is the loss of water resources hanna said something that affects all forms of agriculture including grazing for livestock
for ghodbane drought has meant that he needs to water the wheat and barley he also grows using an irrigation system something that takes time and money he said he is becoming more heavily dependent on well water as rainfall disappears
around the region herders are searching for water by digging new and deeper wells to reach aquifers some share water with neighboring landowners by taking turns using a common well
but by no means will this replace the need for better policy or support from government and actually the global community in addressing issues related to climate change hanna said
algerias government has tried to help herders including by providing limited subsidies to offset some of their increasing costs for water and feed but for smallscale herders in algerias eastern aurès mountains such help may not be enough to offset quickening environmental change
nothing else
ghodbane who was born on the land he now farms says the seasons are changing with longer summers interfering with the spring and fall rains that are crucial to strong harvests and herding years
despite the changing climate however he remains committed to his work
this is the future of our region he said there is nothing else in farming country
his son abdel hak disagrees
he started helping his father herd sheep during the summers between school sessions when he was 10 years old after graduating from high school he followed in his fathers footsteps and has worked on the farm full time for the past five years herding animals from six in the morning to eight in the evening
it teaches you patience and to be responsible abdel hak said but he wouldnt recommend the job its very hard he said
now in his early 20s he would like to go back to school he wants to be a pilot"

aaron judge put what could be his final touch on a likely rookie of the year campaign going 13 with 1 hr 1 rbi and 1 r giving him 52 hr and 114 rbi matt cain finished his career on a strong note despite taking a no decision as he tossed 50 shutout innings allowing 2 h and 1 bb striking out 4 over 50 ip against the padres clayton kershaws final tune up was unimpressive allowing 3 er on 7 h over 40 ip in colorado what else happened on the field that we need to know about lets take a look
1 lance mccullers struggles in his final start
taking on the red sox in boston he allowed 5 er on 6 h and 2 bb striking out 6 over 41 ip while its easy to see the upside potential 2017 has to be considered a disappointment for mcculllers as hes battled injury and ended the season with a 425 era and 130 whip of course he also entered the day with a 616 groundball rate 992 k9 and 299 bb9 over 1141 ip showing that he has the potential to be a fantasy ace if it all comes together a 325 babip and 693 strand rate dragged down the numbers and given the injuries its possible that he gets viewed as a bullpen arm time will tell but at this point view him as a potential james paxton type breakout candidate come 2018
2 no one is going to argue the power of kyle schwarber
he went 24 with 1 hr 4 rbi and 1 r yesterday giving him 30 hr and 69 rbi in 421 ab on the season besides where he ultimately fits defensively the other issue is his 211 average and the problems are twofold first is the obvious as he entered the day with a 310 strikeout rate courtesy of a 123 swstr the other is that he appears to be swinging for the fences a bit with a 155 line drive rate 464 fly ball rate and 163 popup rate elevated strikeouts and popups especially for a player with little speed is going to mean little upside in his average if you need power theres value but you need to be cautious outside of that
3 luke weaver ends on a bad note
taking on the brewers he allowed 6 er on 9 h and 4 bb striking out 4 over 42 ip with the big blow coming courtesy of domingo santana 35 1 hr 2 rbi 1 r it was backtoback poor showings allowing 14 er over 72 ip nearly wiping out all of the good that he had shown prior to this his era ballooned from 205 to 388 the problem was a sudden home run binge 3 hr allowed in these two starts though he entered yesterday showing an ability to generate groundballs 518 though that could regress a little bit given his 444 mark at triplea couple that with strikeouts and control and theres obviously still reason to believe dont let two poor starts change that
4 an acelike performance for jameson taillon
obviously the nationals were resting some of their starters as many teams are these days but it was still an impressive showing for taillon who allowed 1 er on 4 h and 1 bb striking out 5 over 70 ip there was a bit of luck as he didnt allow a home run despite generating 5 groundballs vs 11 fly balls on the day of course that also hasnt been the story of his seasoncareer entering the day with a 479 groundball rate 499 in 2302 ip in the majors couple that with solid strikeouts 853 k9 and control 320 bb9 and its easy to get excited over his longterm appeal dont let his 444 era distract you from the actual upside
5 maikel franco trying to earn 18 starting role
he went 15 with 1 hr 1 rbi and 1 r yesterday giving him home runs in three of his last four games while he does have 23 hr on the season hes also hit just 230 and its not due to contact issues in the least 150 strikeout rate entering the day its obvious that a 237 babip is the issue and while wed expect a better mark his 182 line drive rate and 160 popup rate compared to marks of 200 and 171 in 16 doesnt offer much potential as is you can argue that hes more of a 250ish hitter and nothing more and theres the chance that he loses significant playing time next season hell be a posthype flier but not a player to depend on
6 is carson fulmer backing up the hype
he defeated the indians in his final start of 17 allowing 1 er on 3 h and 2 bb striking out 2 over 50 ip in 231 ip in the majors he posted a 386 era and 124 whip though 19 k vs 13 bb isnt an inspiring ratio he struggled in both categories at triplea prior to his recall with a 686 k9 and 464 bb9 and his 93 swstr and 267 oswing entering the day 6 swinging strikes yesterday doesnt offer much hope for a breakout theres talent and theres going to be hype but hes a backend option at best
7 a disappointing finish for lucas sims
taking on the marlins he allowed 6 r on 7 h and 4 bb striking out 1 over 20 ip against the marlins the youngster entered the majors carrying the risk of home runs 342 groundball rate at triplea but hes also struggled to generate many swings and misses against mlb hitters he entered the day with an 84 swstr and 284 oswing maybe he figures it out with more experience but for now hes going to be a hands off proposition until he proves otherwise
8 is there any value in jake junis moving forward
he ended on a high note allowing 2 r on 5 h and 2 bb striking out 5 over 60 ip against the diamondbacks to finish with a 430 era and 128 whip over 981 ip in the majors he didnt show much in the strikeout department in the majors with a 732 k9 courtesy of an 89 swstr while he showed more at triplea this season 1090 k9 that was a bit of an aberration 885 k9 at doublea in 16 throw in only pedestrian groundball rates and there isnt a significant amount of upside he would appear to be more of a backend optionstreamer depending on the situation and matchup but its hard to envision him ultimately becoming much more than that
9 marcus semien is finally finding his power stroke
there was a lot of upside entering the season but his early season injury zapped a lot of the hype and potential he finally appears to have it all behind him of course maybe too little too late though it again gives us the same type of hope heading into 18 he went 25 with 1 hr 1 rbi and 1 r yesterday giving him 4 hr in his past 10 games hes still struggling with his average hitting 249 and that could be the type of player that he is bringing both power and speed 10 hr12 sb a 250 hitter is more than enough and look for him to be a buy low option heading into next season
10 mitch haniger continues making up for lost time
he went 55 with 1 r yesterday including 3 doubles and is hitting 365 with 7 hr as well as 8 doubles and 1 triple 14 rbi and 17 r in september injuries have dragged down the overall numbers but hes still hitting 285 with 16 hr over 365 ab this season if you project that out over a full 550 ab you get the exact player we were expecting with nothing unrealistic behind it 331 babip 160 hrfb while its hard to imagine much of a posthype sleeper heading into 18 if his value drops at all due to the face value numbers there is going to be appeal

they know what theyve been doing theyve been misrepresenting the dangers of these dangerous addictive drugs for years state rep gen digirolamo
those pharmaceutical companies have made billions of dollars off the deaths of our children and our loved one delaware county councilman david white
big pharma companies have a significant presence in the suburban counties surrounding philadelphia pennsylvania however being neighbors doesnt matter since delaware county the se pennsylvania county constituting some of philadelphias western suburbs filed a lawsuit on september 21 2017 against eleven pharmaceutical companies regarding the overwhelming opioid epidemic and problem
the reason for the lawsuit is the amount of money delaware county had and has to pay for all types of services rendered and other expenses due to opioid drug abuses
delaware county represented by attorney robert j mongeluzzi of saltz mongeluzzi barrett a philadelphia law firm filed a civil suit against pharmaceutical companies and the medical doctors who advised the companies regarding misinformation provided by the drug makers to physicians and others
attorney mongeluzzi said the lawsuit will show big pharma funded false companies which created disinformation to hoodwink and convince doctors that opioids werent addictive rumblings of tobacco science there
according to mongeluzzi 20 percent of all doctors visits in 2014 resulted with an opioid prescription what was the incentive behind that type of pillpushing
in another philadelphia suburb bensalem bucks county bensalem mayor joe digirolamo and township leaders are working on filing a huge civil lawsuit against four pharma companies including johnson johnson and purdue pharma
according to the attorney who will be filing bensalems lawsuit greg heller as pro bono counsel nuisance fraud negligence in some situations breach of contract apparently will be some of the charges filed fraud seems to be a prominent attribute mentioned by those who complain about pharma tactics regarding pillpushing cjf emphasis
mayor digirolamo says these distributors and drug makers have to take an obligation and understand whats happening and get a handle on it
it will be extremely efficacious legally when some lawsuit can get that legal point embedded in case law and have it applied at law regarding the overlypowerful money talks big pharma strangleholds on the cdc fda and public health agencies due to their lobbying techniques but more so with their fraudulent selfproducedfundedoftenfraudulentandpseudoscientific consensus science research plus their everpresent sham medical journals they own produce and publish lets not forget big pharmas media presence advertising and political leverage
after all the us congress seemingly has been in pharmas back pocket ever since congress gave vaccine makers a get out of jail free card in 1986 with the infamous national childhood vaccine injury act ncvia of 1986 42 usc 300aa1 to 300aa34
ever since then vaccine makers have gone hog wild with manufacturing vaccines for anything and everythingregardless however those toxic jabs have been championed by us health agencies cdcfda to the point of supersaturation of vaccines and misinformation about them
if delaware county and bensalem are suing pharma because of misinformation provided by the drug makers to physicians and others that resulted in the opioid crises whats to say that similar malfeasance has not occurred with vaccine biologicals
not only should big pharma vaccine makers be sued but the us cdc and fda should be included for not performing proper oversight of the drugvaccine licensure processes by accepting andor creating fraudulent information that was disseminated globally to other nation states health agencies including the world health organization
during the discovery process for every classaction lawsuit filed against pharmaceuticals and their makers interesting documents surfaced proving hankypanky science and surprises even cdcfda may not have known
regarding a lawsuit against cdcfda plaintiffs and their lawyers can prove from the public record the abuse committed by government agencies by not properly safeguarding and disseminating correct vaccine science information as far back as 1999 with
the verstraeten study implicating the mmr vaccine in autism which led to the famous simpsonwood conference of june 2000 when 52 speciallyinvited pharma and who executives powwowed with cdcfda to agree to rework the data to prove no ethylmercury thimerosal association which dr verstraeten eventually did was published and disseminated by the cdcfda globally source and source the poul thorsen fraudulent autism studies which the cdc promotes as the primary studies indicating no asd and mmr vaccine connection need to be retracted as thorsen is wanted by the cdc for fraud and other counts which i am in the process of writing another article about the movement to get thorsen extradited back to the usa to face the indictmentsource reuters the august 2010 false vaccine efficacy qui tam lawsuit filed in philadelphia federal court by two former merck company employees alleging merck for almost ten years falsified the efficacy rate of the mumps active in its mmr vaccine at 95 whereas merck allegedly added some rabbit blood magic to the efficacy tests to prove efficacy s v merck co cdc epidemiologist whistleblower william thompson phd who produced thousands of documents for us congressman bill posey regarding the unbelievable scientific fraud the cdc committed regarding destroying pertinent data proving the association between autism and the mmr vaccine in young black boys less than three years of age see the documentary vaxxed from coverup to catastrophe
a short video of rep posey asking for a congressional investigation into vaccines
httpsyoutubejgrjn_gijw0
the above facts are more than real or accurate they are publicly known and hiding in plain sight yet congress the courts the media or some clarence darrowlikelawyer have not taken on that winnable legal challenge based on scientific fraud and the harm done to innocent children and adults plus the dissemination of false medical information regarding vaccines that have damaged infants toddlers teens and adults
the proof is found in the hhshrsa vicp adjudication awards paid pages 8 and 9
a clarence darrow would argue eloquently how almost three generations of children are on the autism spectrum since the mandated and uploaded vaccine schedules since 1989 that us children are the least healthy but the most vaccinated in the world and nonvaccinated children are much healthier than vaccinated children
a clarence darrow would point dramatically to the fact united states comes in last again on health compared to other countries
source the commonwealth fund via nbc news link above
clarence darrow would point out the overwhelming extent of scientific fraud 1
he would win his case as darrow was a civil liberties proponent and whats more likely to be an infringement upon civil liberties than denial of bodily integrity and choice in taking care of ones body especially when fraudulent information is pushed to mandate certain vestedinterest products vaccines and pills including opioids must be taken and used
is there a modernday plaintiffs clarence darrow anywhere

the navajo county sheriffs office said the teen is a suspect in the killing of 54yearold terrilynne collins during a struggle at her familys getaway property and future retirement home deputies said they took the teen into custody without incident wednesday evening
phoenixarea lawyer ernest collins jr said he was on the phone with his wife who had called him as she went to a trailer on the rural property 160 miles northeast of phoenix in response to a text for help from the couples 18yearold daughter
collins told the associated press that he was able to hear much of what happened during the fatal encounter in concho a small rural community
trooper kameron lee an arizona department of public safety spokesman provided the victims identity but told the ap that investigators did not want to release additional information on the circumstances of the incident including how terrilynne collins was killed
collins an attorney in mesa was distraught at times during a phone interview with the ap
he said he didnt immediately understand what was going on when his wife called him after midnight and woke him from a deep sleep she was apparently walking to the trailer where their daughter and the daughters friend were staying at the time
as he listened to his wife confront the intruder i finally realized that she had someone at gunpoint collins said
he immediately called a neighbor in concho and asked her to send her husband to the collins property the neighbor said he should call 911 instead when collins did that he was told deputies were already dispatched and he believed his wife had called 911 before heading for the trailer
collins said he then got back on the call from his wife and heard her speak with the intruder whom he thinks was wearing a ski mask and was armed with a knife
i heard my wife telling him youre just a kid youre just a stupid kid and youre going to ruin your life collins said
the conversation went back and forth with the suspect telling collins wife to shoot him in the head the husband said
im yelling as loud as i can through the phone to shoot the expletive shoot him collins said
collins said his wife yelled at their daughter and her friend to run from the trailer and they did with the daughter hearing a gunshot as she got outside
my wife did not come out of the trailer the husband said
concho elementary school district administrator steve yoder said the boy was enrolled as a seventhgrader at the school for 10 days before switching back to home schooling two weeks ago
collins said his wife of nearly 21 years was a devout christian and a very devoted mom to their six children and that she loved the concho area where they planned to retire everything that we ever wanted was up there and now its just gone

"__label__real southgate has won six of his 11 matches as england manager losing twice
gareth southgate successfully completed phase one of his task since succeeding sam allardyce as england manager by qualifying for the 2018 world cup
england secured their place in russia with a 10 victory over slovenia at wembley on thursday but it was a struggling spluttering performance that only underlined the scale of the task facing southgate if he is to end an almost unbroken tale of underachievement at recent major tournaments
fabio capellos england were thrashed 41 by germany in the last 16 at the world cup in south africa in 2010 and his successor roy hodgson could not get england out of the group stage in brazil four years later
hodgson lost to italy on penalties in the last eight of euro 2012 before the embarrassment of a last16 defeat by iceland at euro 2016 was the catalyst for his resignation
there was little fanfare celebration or sense of expectation around a discontented wembley as england limped over the finishing line on thursday only evidence that southgate has a huge job to get his squad in shape for next summer
so what are the big issues facing 47yearold southgate who was officially placed in charge in november 2016 after allardyces 67day reign as he plans to end englands cycle of failure
stick with hart in goal
joe hart was at fault for one of icelands goals at euro 2016
joe hart has been unchallenged as englands firstchoice tournament keeper since euro 2012 in poland and ukraine but the 30yearold is now facing the twin obstacles of declining form and increased competition
hart made crucial errors and had technical flaws exposed when conceding longrange goals to gareth bale against wales and icelands decisive goal from kolbeinn sigthorsson both low and to his left from distance at euro 2016 and endured a mixed spell on loan at torino when pep guardiola decided he was not his man at manchester city
now at west ham hart came under further scrutiny when conceding freekicks to leigh griffiths in the 22 draw with scotland at hampden park in june
southgate surprised many with his staunch faith in hart who made his international debut in june 2008 when retaining him for qualifiers in malta and at home to slovakia although he made an important double save before harry kanes late winner against slovenia at wembley on thursday
however the return to form and fitness of stokes jack butland out for more than a year after injuring an ankle playing for england in germany means the goalkeeping debate will continue
with jordan pickford who is only 23 a rare shaft of light in evertons desperate start to the season after his 30m move from sunderland the debate is likely to be pored over on a weekly basis as england keep faith with hart but also have the best backup options they have enjoyed for years
southgate may be taking a history lesson when it comes to england changing keepers after the failed introduction of scott carson for the key euro 2008 qualifier at home to croatia and rob greens blunder that gave the united states a draw in the opening game of the 2010 world cup
southgates goalkeeping options since start of 201617 league joe hart jack butland fraser forster tom heaton jordan pickford heaton is currently injured games played 44 12 45 39 36 goals conceded 75 19 55 52 62 saves made 119 37 100 149 156 clean sheets 9 3 17 10 5 errors leading to goals 5 0 2 0 3 save 61 65 64 74 72
former england pair phil neville and chris waddle believe southgate has made the correct decision in sticking with hart
neville tells bbc sport patience is the key and gareth has got it absolutely right if the first world cup game was next week joe hart would be my number one
hell want to protect his young goalkeepers pickford has got a lot on his plate to establish himself and have a full season at everton hes moved for a big price tag
butland is only 24 and was out for a very long time with injury last year it is a big season in terms of fitness can he play a full season has he got the durability
waddle says joe is in the driving seat unless he makes a couple of big mistakes
there are certain positions in the team where you need settled partnerships you need your goalkeeper to know his back four well and his centrehalves it is a problem when you are throwing people in before or during a tournament
former england defender terry butcher who believes it is time for change says if you have got someone with jack butlands presence behind you it gives even more confidence but with joe there have been mistakes
joe has done very well for england but his time has come to an end now
southgates instincts for now at least tell him to stick with hart
can the centre of defence take the strain
in the 12 matches since euro 2016 england have started with six different centreback combinations the regular pairing has been gary cahill and john stones six matches cahill has started 11 out of 12 games
englands changing central defensive partnerships have always survived in relative comfort in qualifiers only to be picked apart in the heat of tournament combat
gary cahill and phil jagielka were exposed by luis suarez and edinson cavani in defeat by uruguay in brazil in 2014 while chelseas captain and chris smalling fared no better in france two years later
will it be any different in russia
southgate still has shuffling to do in this position but some pointers are emerging that might signpost the way to his partnership next summer
cahill and manchester uniteds rejuvenated phil jones have started to establish a partnership although a glance towards manchester city may offer an even more attractive option
john stones disappeared almost unnoticed from englands team after being heralded as the future of their defence following a 475m move from everton to manchester city in summer 2016 he is now showing the sort of form that might tempt southgate once more
neville says if we are going into a major tournament in six or seven months time and john stones isnt our number one centreback then he is not fulfilling his potential
in the world cup john stones has got to be our number one centreback that is if he performs he has to produce the qualities we know he has got and if he does he will start as number one centreback probably alongside phil jones
phil nevilles england starting xi at the 2018 world cup
waddle however has an interesting twist and potential for leftfield experimentation he says have we got the quality of defenders to cope with the top sides at the minute it is a concern
id like to see kyle walker play a game in central defence hes quick hes strong hes good in the air and hes got unbelievable energy
a lot of people say youll miss him on the flank but youve still got people like nathaniel clyne when he hopefully gets fit again at liverpool and kieran trippier at spurs
it would be really interesting if you put stones walker and another in there as an experiment
you could play stones walker and eric dier decent on the ball mobility and you have walkers raw pace as well
chris waddles england starting xi at the 2018 world cup
will lack of midfield creativity dent englands chances
englands central midfield combinations are workmanlike but lack players in the mould of steven gerrard frank lampard and paul scholes the pass master who can make a difference
it will prove a serious handicap in russia if england struggle to serve the most potent part of their team with harry kane up front and dele alli in behind
it is not helped by a lack of contenders to play the role of finding the key to unlocking opposition defences
the biggest talking point in southgates team is in central midfield says neville
it is crying out for a creative player could it be jordan henderson eric dier and adam lallana when hes fit there is a space in midfield there is a position on the righthand side and in central midfield
steven gerrard was the last england player to score more than once at a world cup with two goals in 2006
englands central midfield will be resolute in russia but where is the inspiration and creation
sometimes you need someone with a variation of pass england have players who can get it and give it says waddle
i dont think people like jordan henderson have played badly but sometimes you need someone who can get the ball off the back three or four and can just turn and see someone 40 or 50 yards away
the only two who come to mind at the minute who hit that sort of pass are danny drinkwater and jonjo shelvey henderson is very good at linking the play with simple football as are dier and jake livermore lallana is giveandgo not a 30 or 40yard passer
i know what people can say drinkwater might not get in chelseas team and shelvey can let himself down but they can hit those passes
people like shelvey and drinkwater are maybe not everyones cup of tea but you have to look at a system and balance you shouldnt just pick the best english players at the top clubs
shelvey has created the most chances of englands midfield contenders since the start of last season although he was playing in the championship for newcastle in 201617
who are englands world cup matchwinners
england have a striker close to world class in harry kane and there are reasons for optimism if southgate can find a way to serve a potentially deadly attack
dele alli has proved his quality if not his temperament for spurs and england while manchester uniteds marcus rashford looks increasingly like a certain starter in russia
where are the goals coming from since gary lineker scored 10 goals in two world cups 1986 1990 no england player has scored more than twice at the tournament the current england squad has scored 60 goals between them harry kane and jermain defoe are responsible for 31 of those
so are there reasons for england to be cheerful heading into the 2018 world cup after the trauma of recent major tournaments
the kanealli axis will carry englands threat according to waddle kane just doesnt seem to miss he is in the right position every time and you cant coach that he says
you have to play dele alli with him now we have to look at how to get the best out of those players and build a team around them
alli is a cert he plays with kane week in and week out he makes a lot of his goals for him and they have a great partnership
englands world cup wins 2014 none 2010 slovenia 10 2006 paraguay 10 trinidad tobago 20 ecuador 10 2002 argentina 10 denmark 30 1998 tunisia 20 colombia 20
phil neville looks towards his former home of old trafford for the forward southgate should integrate alongside kane and alli
fast forward seven months and you have got to be saying rashford should be in there says neville
if gareth can find a system for both rashford and kane then that would be as exciting a partnership as most teams could offer going forward
kane is at that level now where he is becoming a worldclass centreforward and rashford has got the potential to be there if he keeps developing
rashford is going to be a superstar ive said it a million times i really believe that you can see him kane and dele alli producing
if southgate can use englands forthcoming friendlies to forge a link between that trio he and his squad can carry serious danger in russia next summer
should kane be englands world cup captain
outsiders even then england manager fabio capello never understand the nations obsession with who leads the team out
however it still matters and it seems southgate has narrowed it down to a choice between kane and henderson who have both had auditions during the world cup qualifiers
harry kane has scored 11 goals for england including six in his past five appearances
kane captained the team against slovakia he has the advantage of being a certain starter a goalscoring inspiration and a role model on and off the field while henderson may need to fight for his place
neville is certain who it should not be he says ive never been a fan of centreforwards being captain they are under enough pressure to score goals as it is i would just say to harry kane you just concentrate on scoring goals
id give it someone like jordan henderson or eric dier could be a real outside chance if he cements his place in the team
butcher has a different view there is only one person for me and that is the person who is going to play on a regular basis and that is harry kane he says he is the poster boy but he is also producing the goods
he is one of the first if not the first name on the team sheet you couldnt say that about jordan henderson
you cant argue with kanes record or the way he goes about his work he is a lethal striker but an absolute gentleman off the pitch"

cnn next month president donald trump plans to visit beijing a trip that will come amid rising tensions on the korean peninsula persistent trade concerns and a raft of other thorny issues in uschina relations while the president has sought to build a strong personal relationship with chinese president and communist party general secretary xi jinping in part to yield cooperation on north korean proliferation the administration must develop a longterm policy approach that challenges china to abide by its international commitments adhere to universal standards and embrace the rule of law
sen marco rubio
rep chris smith
principled american leadership is needed now more than ever in recent years the bipartisan congressionalexecutive commission on chinas cecc annual reports have found that under president xis leadership china has failed to deliver on longpromised economic reforms and has become more authoritarian domestically it is also increasingly dismissive of international norms and western ideas and more assertive in its extraterritorial reach the ceccs 2017 annual report which will be released on thursday documents even more regression
although president xi has stressed the need for global connectivity and openness domestic censorship leaves little room for journalism and public debate just last week the use of whatsapp a popular messaging app was blocked as stated in the report china continues to strengthen the worlds most sophisticated system of internet control and press censorship and forges ahead with what it calls internet sovereignty
xi has worked hard to consolidate his power demanding strict ideological discipline from party and government officials and using an extensive anticorruption campaign to eliminate many of his political rivals
over the past year chinese authorities targeted labor and environmental activists demanded loyalty from scholars and intellectuals and clamped down on foreign nongovernmental organizations media outlets think tanks and internet companies restrictions on religious freedom also intensified particularly in ethnic minority tibetan and uyghur areas coercive enforcement of population control policies continued in violation of international standards and the government persisted in forcibly repatriating north korean refugees to face near certain persecution and even death in contravention of chinas international legal obligations

"__label__real washington reuters us president donald trump who pledged to help protect young people known as dreamers brought illegally to the united states as children called on sunday for money to fund a border wall to be part of any immigration deal
in a list of principles laid out in documents released by the white house the trump administration also pressed for a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the united states many of them from central america
the plan which was delivered to leaders in congress on sunday night drew a swift rebuke from democrats who are seeking a legislative fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca program that trump ended last month
the administration cant be serious about compromise or helping the dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the dreamers to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of americans said house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer
the list includes the wall which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations if the president was serious about protecting the dreamers his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so they said in a statement
the trump administration wants the wish list to guide immigration reform in congress and accompany a bill to replace daca the obamaera program that protected nearly 800000 dreamers from deportation and allowed them to secure work permits
if enacted the white house priorities could result in the deportation of dreamers parents
related coverage democrats rule out trumps request for border wall funding in help for dreamers
the proposals emphasize immigration enforcement and include a request for funds to hire 370 more immigration judges 1000 attorneys for the immigration and customs enforcement agency 300 federal prosecutors and 10000 additional ice agents to enforce immigration laws
these priorities are essential to mitigate the legal and economic consequences of any grant of status to daca recipients trumps legislative affairs director marc short told reporters on a conference call the white house made clear it would not be pushing for dreamers to achieve us citizenship only legal status in a potential deal
trump told congress it had six months to come up with legislation to help dreamers who are a fraction of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the united states most of whom are hispanic
the documents call for tighter standards for those seeking us asylum denial of federal grants to sanctuary cities that serve as refuges for illegal immigrants and a requirement that employers use an electronic verification system known as everify to keep illegal immigrants from securing jobs
us president donald trump talks to the media on south lawn of the white house in washington before his departure to greensboro north carolina us october 7 2017 reutersyuri gripas
hard line
trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the us border with mexico he vowed repeatedly that mexico would pay for the wall but began prodding congress earlier this year to approve funding mexico has said it will not pay for the wall
trumps suggestion after a meeting with schumer and pelosi that wall funding would not have to be part of a daca fix alarmed some of his supporters
the white house sees the wall as a priority but has indicated that it could be established as part of a daca bill or through other legislative avenues administration officials said that legislation that did not include all of the priorities on the list would not necessarily trigger a presidential veto
republicans in congress have introduced several bills that include aspects of trumps ideas but many democrats and immigration groups see the proposals as too harsh
the trump administration has put forth a serious proposal to address the enforcement of our immigration laws and border security said republican house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte in a statement we cannot fix the daca problem without fixing all of the issues that led to the underlying problem of illegal immigration in the first place
the white houses wish list targets the flow of unaccompanied minors into the united states it would require such children to be treated the same regardless of their countries of origin so long as they are not victims of human trafficking and can be safely returned home or removed to safe third countries the white house documents said
it would expand the list of inadmissible aliens to include members of gangs those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony and former spouses and children of drug and human traffickers if they receive benefits from such behavior
the plan also seeks to reduce the number of people who overstay their visas and reform how green cards that establish legal permanent residents are granted
trumps white house has so far not been able to achieve a major legislative victory casting doubt on the potential for a breakthrough on immigration reform which republican and democratic presidents have tried before without success
since trump took office in january his fellow republicans have failed to repeal and replace former democratic president barack obamas affordable care act known as obamacare and a white house plan for tax reform needs more support

"__label__real to the extent that her weekly 11 pm show is aimed at black viewers ms thede said im speaking to stories that matter to us
photo
but her approach she said is the same one taken by the other members of latenight tvs mostly white male fraternity those hosts ms thede said are speaking to the stories that they feel matter to them theyre certainly not saying women dont watch or black people dont watch
what will ultimately bring an audience to the rundown ms thede said is the opportunity to laugh and to get an authentic opinion about stories theyre not going to hear anywhere else
the program is both a risky proposition and a potential breakthrough for bet which has a sporadic history of latenight talkshow programming and for ms thede who was most recently the head writer and an occasional performer on comedy centrals the nightly show with larry wilmore
on a recent wednesday morning ms thede was working out of her corner office in midtown manhattan a work space furnished with a designer ticktacktoe board and some downmarket fidget spinners
as she prepared to shoot a test show later in the week ms thede noted several news stories that the rundown could mine for material professional athletes protesting racial injustice o j simpsons release from prison facialrecognition software that misidentifies black people
ms thede explained were not going to spend a halfhour telling you trump is bad because black people didnt vote for him anyway they know that
photo
the rundown is bets first latenight talk show since the monique show which ran from 2009 to 2011 monique the comedian and academy awardwinning actress was one of very few black women to have hosted such a program including wanda sykes whose fox show ran one season in 20092010 and whoopi goldberg whose show ran in syndication from 1992 to 1993

connie orlando bets head of programming said in an interview that ms thede had approached the network just when it was looking to expand its afterhours offerings
it was something that made sense for the direction were going in ms orlando said of the rundown we realized our real prime time starts at 10 and our audience loves to laugh it felt like the perfect moment to add the voice of an africanamerican female to the conversation
ms orlando said she believed the programs topical content and viral potential would help it reach viewers who might not otherwise be watching bet
the shows going to cover anything from cardi b to whats happening in the white house she said and i think all kinds of audiences will be interested to know and listen to what robin has to say
ms thede has broken ground here before when she joined mr wilmores nightly show as its head writer she became the first black woman in latenight tv to hold such a title
mr wilmore said in an interview that when he sought ms thede for the job she was already getting ready to move to new york and knew in her mind that she had the job

thats robins personality mr wilmore added whatever happens in her mind is going to be real shes that strong of a thinker
ms thede grew up in davenport iowa her mother phyllis is now a democratic member of the states house of representatives her father dave a teacher turned her on to the comedy albums of richard pryor and eddie murphy and ms goldbergs performances on comic relief ms thede was named after robin williams

she performed in campus sketchcomedy groups while a student at northwestern universitys medill school of journalism and trained at the second city improv theater in chicago before she joined up with mr wilmore she wrote for several bet awards shows and its realitytv satire real husbands of hollywood and was head writer of daytime tvs the queen latifah show
the nightly show provided ms thede with opportunity and exposure she was the head writer for mr wilmores performance at the 2016 white house correspondents dinner which drew some criticism when mr wilmore referred to president obama as my nigga
today ms thede shrugs off any backlash those jokes still hold up and theyre genius she said i think that in an age of trump history will be kinder to that performance
photo
the abrupt cancellation of the nightly show in august 2016 was a gut punch but did not turn ms thede off from latenight comedy
i sold this show like two weeks later she said with a laugh i was sad and im still sad it felt like we should have been able to stay on through the election but i wasnt discouraged at all i was empowered
though she never felt she had to compromise her voice at comedy central ms thede said that while she was there because youre speaking to a majoritywhite audience you are explaining things a little bit more from your perspective
on bet she continued i dont have to take that step i can just speak how i speak both bet and comedy central are owned by viacom
at its outset the rundown will not feature any comic correspondents or celebrity guest interviews just ms thedes satirical takes as well as skits and documentary segments that will feature her there will also be occasional popup concerts by surprise musicians

as she gets ready to take center stage ms thede is drawing inspiration from other latenight stars like samantha bee of tbss full frontal who she said naturally gravitates to subjects that other hosts overlook and jimmy kimmel of abcs jimmy kimmel live who has offered his intensely personal perspectives on broader issues of health care and gun control
mr wilmore who has remained a friend of ms thedes said the proliferation of topical comedy programs would make it challenging for the rundown to find an audience but not impossible
recounting advice he had given ms thede mr wilmore said just be the best version of who you are onscreen and whatever happens after that you cant really control either itll cut through that or it wont but the more youre that the better chance you have
while ms thede is mentally preparing herself for a healthy 10year run she said she is already proud to have given jobs to candidates who had not previously worked in late night
by her own estimate ms thede said that on a staff of about 40 75 percent were women andor people of color and she said several departments were headed by women
she stopped herself for a moment headed by a woman is that a word that sounds odd its certainly not beheaded
with wicked delight ms thede continued unless they dont do their jobs i rule with an iron fist"

on the surface the plan was simple and straightforward and fueled by the best of motives after hearing for months about attacks on growing numbers of american citizens who claim they are being assaulted with unconventional weapons pastor s name withheld on his request a pastor at an evangelical church in india decided to take definitive action
his plan was to travel to the us to meet with other pastors including dallas pastor chuck pierce who purportedly has the ear of president trump s was going to lay out the types of attacks that individuals are now reporting and ask the president to make sure that the intelligence agencies stop their nonconsensual testing of these weapons including microwave and sonics on selected american citizens
what pastor s did not gamble on however was the massive surveillance apparatus of these intelligence agencies which apparently swung into gear in order to effectively stop him in his tracks
s flew into dallas international airport on september 4 buoyed by the prospects of a potentially successful good will mission he didnt get any further than the airport however he was stopped upon deboarding and subsequently interrogated and detained by customs and border protection for over 24 hours his visa to the uspreviously good until 2020was summarily canceled and he was put on a plane back to india by way of dubai
no meetings with chuck pierce and no meetings with trump pastor s reports that he was held in a cell and denied appropriate food for over 24 hours he also states he was denied access to the indian consulate and also forced to pay for his trip back contrary to protocols his return ticketfor about a month laterwas not honored by emirates airline and upon landing in dubai where he was to change planes to india he was threatened with arrest if he did not pay for that flight
upon reaching his final destination in india he was again threatened with arrest for nonpayment of the ticket he reports that his luggage and passport were seized by emirates airline as collateral until he paid the full fare
cbp has protocols in place for the removal of an unwanted person the press office for cbp stated
according to the immigration and nationality act a traveler who arrived at a us port of entry and is ordered removed shall be removed by the owner of the aircraft on which the traveler arrived to the united states the law further states that the owner of the aircraft on which the traveler arrived in the united states shall pay the transportation costs of removing the traveler
emirates appears to have taken unusual steps in violating this act when contacted concerning reports that emirates staff had threatened s and had seized his belongings emirates issued this terse statement
we do not discuss individual passenger cases for privacy reasons emirates has no jurisdiction over decisions made by the authorities when it comes to visa and entry requirements
according to cbp pastor s was denied entry because he intended to work in the us and his visa disallowed this cbp states that a valid visa does not guarantee entry into the us there are many reasons for a person to be denied entry in this case cbp officers determined that mr was traveling with a tourist visa but intended to work which is not authorized when visiting the us as a tourist
however s maintains that there was no gainful monetary aspect to his trip to the us he also denies the assertion by the press office at cbp that he was given the opportunity to contact the indian consulate
according to the pastor he was offered only red meat to eat during his detention in dallas which for religious reasons he declined upon arriving back in india he was so weak from lack of nourishment that he was hospitalized he is diabetic
according to nsa whistleblower karen melton stewart who helped raise funds for this mission to the us he has gone into seclusion in india in order to recover from the mistreatment
stewart states that he is now traumatized he has been here four times before and was treated quite well says stewart this time he was treated like a criminal
the indian embassy has requested a statement from the pastor concerning his treatment in dallas
increasing numbers of individuals are now claiming assault by unconventional electronic weapons the targets now include several former intelligence officers who apparently fell afoul of the mandates of their agencies a recent mainstream news report states that us diplomats in cuba were also assaulted by sonic weapons which buttresses allegations which had previously been consigned to the conspiracy culture

both tepco and the government argued that earthquake predictions made by the governments own research unit were too vague and that they could not have taken appropriate measures to guard against the flooding that occurred
in its defense the government said that before the meltdowns it did not have the power to force tepco to take protective antiflooding measures and that it was authorized to do so only by legislation passed after the accident
we understand the court did not fully acknowledge the governments defense said kazuhiro okuma manager of the general affairs division of the nuclear regulation authority we will now regulate power stations properly by applying a new regulation standard which was created based on the nuclear accident
in march the utility and the government suffered their first legal setback in litigation over the accident in its ruling the maebashi district court in gunma prefecture said that the disaster had been predictable and that it had been possible to prevent the accident
the court ordered the government and tepco to pay damages totaling 38 million yen or about 335000 to 62 residents who were evacuated from the towns around the fukushima plant and who relocated to gunma each was awarded a different amount but the total worked out to an average of 5400 a person

a new video has emerged from the night of the las vegas shooting that appears to show overlapping gunfire coming from multiple locations which clearly contradicts the mainstream narrative of what occurred on the night 59 people were killed and over 500 were injured
the video is under 3 minutes long and was filmed by an individual who appears to be hiding near a gate during the shooting while crowds of people can be seen running from the area the person filming the video is staying low to the ground with a group of people who are encouraging others to take cover instead of running out into the open
no we are not moving just stay down one girl says dont leave just stay down
the first burst of gunfire can be heard at the 015 mark followed almost immediately by a second burst of gunfire that sounds distinctly different the same thing happens again at the 201 mark with secondary gunfire beginning at the 206 mark
it is important to note that while this video does appear to confirm multiple shooters there are a number of varying scenarios that couldve produced these effects the acoustics in a massive concrete city like las vegas can certainly play tricks on even the most astute audiophiles
while this is not exactly a smoking gun this video certainly warrants further investigation and should not be overlooked however it appears that the mainstream media and police at least publicly have no concern with this evidence
this is not the first evidence of the massacre being carried out by multiple shooters in fact video surfaced on tuesday from a taxi driver who distinctly heard gunfire from two different locations
while sitting in the taxi line at the mandalay bay hotel cori langdon began recording as soon she heard gunshots ring out her video begins with the sounds of distant shooting and within seconds the shooting the gunfire sounds as if it is coming from a different closer location
as the free thought project reported
while there were two windows busted out of paddocks dual room suite the distance between them does not seem far enough away from each other to produce the sounds we hear in the video below also it would have been quite the feat to run between both windows as fast as the firing is heard some of the exchanges happen almost instantly
one week after the las vegas shooting there remain a number of glaring inconsistencies that contradict the official narrative in addition to refusing to acknowledge the growing number of witness accounts that have claimed there were multiple shooters it took the fbi less than 24 hours to pin the entire shooting on one suspect
this suspect 64yearold stephen paddock apparently defied the odds by carrying out what is being called the deadliest mass shooting in modern us history with incredible proficiency using advanced weapons even though he has no military background and he did not have a reputation as a gun guy the idea that the fbi would not be asking the obvious questions about whether other shooters were involved is completely absurd
while some body camera footage has been released from the night of the shooting that gives insight into the chaotic scene from the firsthand perspective of the police officers involved there is one incredibly important piece of video evidence that has yet to be released
according to the fbis official narrative paddock acted alone which means that he was responsible for transporting dozens of rifles thousands of rounds of ammunition and various other supplies up to his hotel room in the days before the shooting luckily he was in one of the most popular hotels in las vegas which means that there should be plenty of security camera footage showing him with his luggageyet none of it has been released
in fact less than 24 hours after the shooting occurred nbc news published a story featuring various photos from security cameras that appeared to show stephen paddock at a casino in the cosmopolitan hotel and then in an emergency room after he fell in 2011 it took just hours to find security footage of paddock from 6 years ago but it has been over a week and the footage from 2 days before the shooting still has not been released
the latest video evidence makes it hard to deny that there were in fact multiple shooters the idea that the fbi refuses to acknowledge the witness testimonieseven with increasing evidenceraises serious questions about the possibility of their agents contribution to the massacre

"__label__fake waiver worthy week 4 wendell smallwood sterling shepard duke johnson more
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
when it comes to playing fantasy football one of the biggest mistakes can be complacency not keeping a close eye on the waiver wire and trying to identify opportunities for production is a mistake injuries are a constant and being prepared with an alternative option is key to anyones success coming out of week 3 who are the players to target lets take a look at some of the options
wendell smallwood running back philadelphia eagles
darren sproles suffered a pair of injuries in week 3 with a broken arm and torn acl and that should end his season while no one player will likely assume all of sproles opportunities smallwood appears to be in the best position to benefit from his absence after picking up 8 yards on 7 carries over the first two weeks he exploded for 71 yards on 12 carries against the giants matching the carries of legarrette blount who turned 12 carries into 67 yards
smallwood was targeted just twice in the passing game but among the strengths in his scouting report prior to the draft as per nflcom was
possesses exceptional hands as an option out of the backfield
you put those things together and you get an ideal target in all formats
verdict must own option in all formats
duke johnson running back cleveland browns
in ppr formats hes an intriguing option as the browns are decimated at wide receiver and need johnson to play a key role he did on sunday with 6 receptions on seven targets for 81 yards and also chipped in 2 carries for 23 yards and a td thats a solid overall day but can we anticipate it continuing
hes made a consistent impact in the passing game with 11 receptions but the carries simply havent been there in ppr formats hes on the flex radar but nothing more
verdict potential ppr flex
robby anderson wide receiver new york jets
it would be easy to get excited after anderson hung 3 receptions for 95 yards and 1 td in week 3 but he only got there thanks to a 69yard reception does anyone really expect him to be able to replicate that type of performance on a weekly basis hes a boom or bust option in a bad offense so dont bother right now
verdict too boom or bust to trust
paul richardson wide receiver seattle seahawks
richardsons recent performance wouldve put him on the map but with doug baldwin suffering a groin injury in week 3 theres little doubt that richardsons role could further expand though the early word is that the injury is not considered serious richardson has now scored in backtoback games and has at least 5 targets in all three games played though he certainly hasnt been very efficient despite 19 targets he has just 8 receptions and while we can point to russell wilson for part of the issues this past sunday richardson converted 7 targets into 2 receptions and 30 yards
maybe if baldwin was going to miss significant time but the inefficiency makes richardson a lowend option regardless
verdict stash in the deepest of formats but untrustworthy starter
sterling shepard wide receiver new york giants
the giants passing game finally woke up and shepard was one of the biggest performers as he posted 7 receptions for 133 yards and 1 td the numbers were bloated by a 77yard catch and the giants are also deep at receiver but the lack of a running game means that there are going to be more than enough opportunities to go around hes not likely going to post these types of big yardage days often but posting 58 receptions for 5070 yards on a weekly basis is very believable consider him a potential wr3 in ppr formats and ownable in all leagues
verdict worth owning in all formats but a better play in ppr formats
geronimo allison wide receiver green bay packers
with randall cobb out allison stepped up picking up 6 catches for 122 yards of course there are only so many balls to go around and if everyone is healthy allison is fourth on the wide receiver depth chart hell also have to battle ty montgomery among others for looks making allison a less than ideal option
verdict shortterm play at best
deep league special
alex collins running back baltimore ravens
it was a disastrous performance from the ravens all the way around and that could be why collins ultimately led the team in carries 9 that said he was by far the most productive even with all hands on deck
alex collins 9 carries for 82 yards
javorius allen 8 carries for 15 yards 5 receptions for 13 yards
terrance west 6 carries for 26 yards
of course it was just last week that allen had 101 yards and 1 td so thinking collins will suddenly emerge as the lead back would be misguided west did lose a fumble in week 3 though and collins has been strong in backtoback games 16 carries for 124 yards there could be an opportunity so hes worth stashing but for now this is a situation to avoid from a starters perspective
verdict stash if you are in need of a rb flier

"__label__real washington reuters a us navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by china in the south china sea on tuesday three us officials told reuters prompting anger in beijing even as president donald trumps administration seeks chinese cooperation in reining in north koreas missile and nuclear programs
the operation was the latest attempt to counter what washington sees as beijings efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters but it was not as provocative as previous ones carried out since trump took office in january
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the chafee a guidedmissile destroyer carried out normal maneuvering operations that challenged excessive maritime claims near the paracel islands among a string of islets reefs and shoals over which china has territorial disputes with its neighbors
chinas defense ministry said on wednesday that a warship two fighter jets and a helicopter had scrambled to warn the us ship away adding it had infringed upon chinas sovereignty and security with its provocation
china would further strengthen its naval and air defenses the ministry said
we demand the us side earnestly take steps to correct its mistakes it added
related coverage china says us violated its sovereignty in south china sea
speaking earlier at a daily news briefing in beijing chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said china had lodged stern representations with the united states and reiterated that the paracels were chinese territory
china will continue to take resolute measures to protect chinese sovereign territory and maritime interests china urges the us to conscientiously respect chinas sovereign territory and security interests conscientiously respect the efforts regional countries have made to protect peace and stability in the south china sea and stop these wrong actions
next month trump makes his first visit to asia as president including a stop in china which he has been pressuring to do more to rein in north korea china is north koreas neighbor and biggest trading partner
unlike in august when a us navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by china in the south china sea officials said the destroyer on tuesday sailed close to but not within that range of the islands
uss chafee a us navy destroyer which operates 100 percent on biofuel sails about 150 miles 241 km north of the island of oahu during the rimpac naval exercises off hawaii july 182012 reutershugh gentry
twelve nautical miles mark internationally recognized territorial limits sailing within that range is meant to show the united states does not recognize territorial claims
the pentagon did not comment directly on the operation but said the united states carried out regular freedomofnavigation operations and would continue to do so
chinas claims in the south china sea through which about 5 trillion in shipborne trade passes each year are contested by brunei malaysia the philippines taiwan and vietnam
experts and some us officials have criticized former president barack obama for potentially reinforcing chinas claims by sticking to innocent passage in which a warship effectively recognized a territorial sea by crossing it speedily without stopping
the us military has a longstanding position that its operations are carried out throughout the world including in areas claimed by allies and that they are separate from political considerations
the united states has said it would like to see more international participation in freedomofnavigation operations in the south china sea
north korea issue
trumps trip to asia will likely be dominated by the north korean nuclear threat he will also visit south korea japan vietnam and the philippines
in recent weeks north korea has launched two missiles over japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test all in defiance of un security council resolutions and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nucleartipped missile capable of hitting the us mainland
trumps visit to china will reciprocate a trip to the united states made in april by chinese president xi jinping the us presidents attempts to get chinese help with north korea have met with limited success so far but he has gone out of his way to thank xi for his efforts"
"__label__fake by peter a kirby
in the course of exposing chemtrails your author has already found and presented quite a bit of evidence linking the theory of manmade global warming to weather modification and thus the new manhattan project lately he has stumbled upon what appears to be the earliest published mention of the modern theory of manmade global warming in addition this same reference is undoubtedly the earliest significant mention of the solar radiation management srm geoengineering thesis the article in question is a 1955 fortune magazine piece written by the famous manhattan project scientist john von neumann 19031957 titled can we survive technology pdf this is the most potent evidence yet in support of the assertion that the theory of manmade global warming is a cover story for the biggest scientific effort in history
if all this stuff about a new manhattan project and srm geoengineering makes zero sense to you then please review the authors previous work chemtrails exposed a history of the new manhattan project theres a whole subculture going on down here
for background on von neumann and his connections to the new manhattan project one may review the authors other previous article chemtrails exposed truly a new manhattan project
can we survive technology
ten years after the detonations of the worlds first atomic bombs and the subsequent japanese surrender and two years before his death fortune magazine published johnny von neumans can we survive technology it is undoubtedly the first significant mention of the srm geoengineering thesis and arguably the first mention of the modern theory of manmade global warming
it is interesting to note that the first words written at the top of the first page read the new goals vi if one glances at this phrase one might read the new gods as the eye will have a tendency to amalgamate the a and the l in the word goals turning these two letters into a d and therefore forming the word gods maybe this is a subliminal message meant to deify von neumann and make no mistake at the time the world was standing in awe after manhattan project scientists such as von neumann had unleashed the terrible destructive power of the atom bomb and developed so many other technologies which enabled the allied powers to win the war top american scientists were drastically reshaping world power and were understandably respected in fact von neumann in particular was a most highly revered scientist indeed a strong argument can be made for von neumann being the most revered american scientist of all time
the opening sentence rings the alarm stating the great globe itself is in a rapidly maturing crisis he then goes over how mans technological capabilities are stretching the earths resources and how this if unchecked might lead to global catastrophe in this way can we survive technology predates the later global warming fear mongering of the central intelligence agency cia in their 1974 document a study of climatological research as it pertains to intelligence problems this document expounds upon the notion that minor fluctuations in earths average global temperature can lead to humanitys extinction never mind that earths average temperature has been fluctuating for as long as humanity has existed on earth and humanity has been doing just fine they are smarter than you and they know just pay your taxes take the medications and vaccinations drink your fluoride recognize the theory of manmade global warming as gospel truth and die this is what the establishment requires of us
for more about the cias a study of climatological research as it pertains to intelligence problems please refer to the authors previous article forging reality the new manhattan chemtrail project information war
its only fitting as in 1952 von neumann became a cia advisor
in his piece von neumann rolls out the theory of manmade global warming and the srm geoengineering thesis here these two theses were fused together to form a giant flaming sword of evil to be used against domestic populations worldwide he begins these sections with quite a bit about weather modification it reads
controlled climate let us now consider a thoroughly abnormal industry and its potentialities that is an industry as yet without a place in any list of major activities the control of weather or to use a more ambitious but justified term climate one phase of this activity that has received a good deal of public attention is rain making the present technique assumes extensive rain clouds and forces precipitation by applying small amounts of chemical agents while it is not easy to evaluate the significance of the efforts made thus far the evidence seems to indicate that the aim is an attainable one but weather control and climate control are really much broader than rain making all major weather phenomena as well as climate as such are ultimately controlled by the solar energy that falls on the earth to modify the amount of solar energy is of course beyond human power but what really matters is not the amount that hits the earth but the fraction retained by the earth since that reflected back into space is no more useful than if it had never arrived now the amount absorbed by the solid earth the sea or the atmosphere seems to be subject to delicate influences true none of these has so far been substantially controlled by human will but there are strong indications of control possibilities
his reference to reflecting sunlight back into space here is the first ever significant mention of the srm geoengineering thesis probably the first of any kind the srm geoengineering thesis was probably conceived by john von neumann also note that von neumann writes of a wholly different type of weather modification program not the conventional cloud seeding industry the new manhattan project is a wholly different kind of weather modification program he makes two later mentions of such a program he follows with the theory of manmade global warming it continues
the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by industrys burning of coal and oil more than half of it during the last generation may have changed the atmospheres composition sufficiently to account for a general warming of the world by about one degree fahrenheit the volcano krakataosic erupted in 1883 and released an amount of energy by no means exorbitant had the dust of the eruption stayed in the stratosphere for fifteen years reflecting sunlight away from the earth it might have sufficed to lower the worlds temperature by six degrees in fact it stayed for about three years and five such eruptions would probably have achieved the result mentioned this would have been a substantial cooling the last ice age when half of north america and all of northern and western europe were under an ice cap like that of greenland or antarctica was only fifteen degrees colder than the present age on the other hand another fifteen degrees of warming would probably melt the ice of greenland and antarctica and produce worldwide tropical to semitropical climate
notice how in this passage von neumann asserts the idea that ash spewing from an erupting volcano in this case krakatoa will reflect sunlight back into space and therefore cool the earth todays geoengineers make this point ad nauseum we can stop wondering where they are getting this idea from von neumanns assertion of the volcanic ash global cooling thesis here may be the first ever
among many other assertions he then goes on to suggest that probably intervention in atmospheric and climatic matters will come in a few decades and will unfold on a scale difficult to imagine at present and the most constructive schemes for climate control would have to be based on insights and techniques that would also lend themselves to forms of climatic warfare as yet unimagined von neumanns imagination has become reality
demarcation between old and new
it is important to note here the use of the word modern when describing von neumanns assertion of the theory of manmade global warming the term modern is used here to describe a version of the theory of manmade global warming which has entered into popular culture and is connected to the srm geoengineering thesis the historical or old version of the theory of manmade global warming was relegated to academia and not connected to the srm geoengineering thesis yes your author is making these grand assertions here and now all by himself
the introduction of the srm geoengineering thesis in johnny von neumanns 1955 fortune piece is the demarcation point between the old and modern versions of the theory of manmade global warming it is reasonable to consider the period before von neumans paper as the era of the old theory of manmade global warming and the period after von neumanns paper as the era of the new or modern theory of manmade global warming this assertion is being made for two reasons can we survive technology was the first insertion of the theory of manmade global warming into the popular culture and can we survive technology was the first major publication of the srm geoengineering thesis
can we survive technology was designed to insert the theory of manmade global warming into the popular culture before can we survive technology the theory of manmade global warming was relegated to scientific journals and obscure books much of the material was in german articles and books relegated to scientific journals andor foreign languages dont tend to get a lot of attention from the american public this article published in a popular american magazine opened the theory of manmade global warming up to many millions of minds and we have seen how far they have ran with it since corrupt politicians and bureaucrats across the globe have artificially shoved this lie into the center of the overton window that process had to start somewhere and can we survive technology was the beginning of that process
the other factor determining von neumanns piece as the demarcation between old and new is the introduction of the srm geoengineering thesis the srm geoengineering thesis effectively weaponized the theory of manmade global warming weaponization in this case requires a huge expansion of the militaryindustrialacademicintelligence complex this meant a big fat gravy train and all parties involved were all for it
beyond von neumann
johnny was not alone von neumann and pretty much all of the other top manhattan project scientists were proponents of what they called planetary engineering analogous of course to todays geoengineering in essence pretty much all of the other top manhattan project scientists were proponents of weather control
following von neumanns lead other prominent scientists later came forward with the srm geoengineering thesis andor the theory of manmade global warming the first three examples of the srm geoengineering thesis are all written in the context of weather modification two out of the first three examples of the srm geoengineering thesis also mention the theory of manmade global warming
in the early months of 1958 manhattan project scientist bernard vonnegut alluded to the srm geoengineering theory in the article he coauthored as part of the most cited weather modification report ever he and his coauthors wrote the radiation properties of the atmosphere can be altered by the introduction of gases or aerosols and by cloud seeding
in june of 1958 weather modifier and science adviser to the president howard t orville wrote an article for popular science magazine titled weather as a weapon which asserted the theory of manmade global warming in addition to the srm geoengineering thesis
the next major incursion in their information war waged against the american public came with the release of a 1965 document emanating from the lbj white house in 1965 called restoring the quality of our environment this orwellianly is that a word titled document asserts both the theory of manmade global warming and the srm geoengineering thesis this document is particularly significant because it was issued by the executive branch of the united states federal government when documents are issued by the executive branch of the united states federal government all government offices must review it and be in general compliance
conclusions
the modern theory of manmade global warming and the srm geoengineering thesis have a symbiotic relationship the srm geoengineering thesis supercharged the old theory of manmade global warming at the same time the srm geoengineering thesis barely exists without the theory of manmade global warming it only makes sense that both would be introduced andor upgraded at the same time
it also makes dollars and sense that von neumanns piece was published in fortune magazine the evidence shows plenty of financial motives behind todays new manhattan project to review these motives one may review the authors previous article cui bono new manhattan project motives
can we survive technology was a weaponization of the theory of manmade global warming and therefore a green light to the militaryindustrialacademicintelligence complex up until the publication of can we survive technology the theory of manmade global warming was only something that existed as just that a theory when the theory of manmade global warming was linked to the srm geoengineering thesis the militaryindustrialacademicintelligence complex had a new enemy to fight the climate a new enemy to fight means more basic science new weapons systems and intelligence agency cover in other words it means a mountain of power and cash raining down upon them in 1955 von neumann handed the militaryindustrialacademicintelligence complex an argument for tremendous expansion and they have taken him up on it ever since spending vast sums on weather modification and the atmospheric sciences in fact it wasnt long after von neumanns 1955 fortune piece that the american militaryindustrialacademicintelligence complex was the beneficiary of tremendous acrosstheboard spending increases catalyzed by russias sputnik launch of 1957
yes due to advancing technology and population growth earths resources are currently being depleted at an unsustainable rate and yes we have lots of big environmental problems but manmade global warming is not one of them and the solutions offered by the establishment are wholly inadequate and counterproductive for crying out loud their solutions to these problems are spraying the earth with toxic chemicals and death their socalled solutions are worse than the problems their solutions are massively destructive cruel and unsustainable
for more about the establishments predilection for mass murder please refer to the authors previous article other new manhattan chemtrail project agendas
mom taught me that there is always a better solution and i taught me that the solution will not come from the top down as have these nonsolutions offered by the establishment all real solutions come from the bottom up the solutions are free energy better governments and the colonization of other planets but those solutions are too empowering for humanity those solutions embody far too much common sense our rulers do not operate on common sense or empowering humanity they operate on greed selfishness and fear and that is why this modern theory of manmade global warming and the srm geoengineering thesis are chosen and promulgated thats why their solution wrecks our environment
i challenge the audience to find an earlier published mention of the srm geoengineering thesis these early mentions are almost all made in combination with the theory of manmade global warming delingpole im ready for my closeup morano are you up to the challenge monckton ill give you a civil debate steyn ill take em all on seriously if somebody out there knows any of these leading climate heretics james delingpole marc morano christopher monckton mark steyn andor others please pass this article on to them i want to know what they think separately ill be sending this article to them via their respective websites
we are in a war people they are trying to make you believe that an apple is an orange so that they may kill you and everything else on the planet i suggest that we refute their assertions please share this link thank you

reuters the united states will be absent from the world cup finals for the first time since 1986 next year after a humiliating 21 defeat at the hands of trinidad tobago in couva on tuesday
despite an inconsistent qualifying campaign the americans entered the ato boldon stadium needing only a win of any sort over the bottom team in the concacaf final qualifying group to punch their ticket to russia
but two firsthalf goals an omar gonzalez own goal in the 17th minute and an alvin jones effort 20 minutes later proved too much for the americans to overcome despite christian pulisics strike after the break
instead panama qualified for the world cup finals for the first time with their 21 victory over costa rica while honduras beat mexico 32 to pip the united states to a playoff place against australia
clearly very disappointing us coach bruce arena told reporters
related coverage factbox list of countries qualified for the 2018 world cup
we had everything there for us today there are no excuses for us not getting the second goal and at least a point out of the game
its a blemish for us we should not be staying home for this world cup and i take the responsibility for that
soccer football 2018 world cup qualifications north central america caribbean trinidad and tobago v united states ato boldon stadium couva trinidad and tobago october 10 2017 trinidads alvin jones celebrates his goal with team mates reutersandrea de silva
it was a stunning turn of events for the us who were supposed to be rebuilding their program after hiring arena last year
weathering some bumps in the road the americans pulled off an emphatic 40 win over panama last week to take a twopoint edge over both panama and honduras and regain control of their destiny
but the us got off to an ominous start against the soca warriors when defender gonzalez tried to clear the ball only for it to loop up and over goalkeeper tim howard and into the net
slideshow 3 images
the guy hit an early cross and when i went to clear it he touched it first and it hit off my shin and it happened to go right over tim howard gonzalez said its one of the most unlucky goals ever its one that will haunt me forever i never thought i would see this day its the worst day of my career
jones doubled the lead when he unleashed a piledriver of a shot from well outside the penalty area that flew past howard and into the net just inside the far post
the us responded in the second half when pulisic also scored from outside the box in the 47th minute to give the visitors hope that they might at least rescue a draw that would have secured them the playoff spot
the desperate effort to level up the match fell short though despite the best efforts of 34yearold clint dempsey who nearly scored twice in the final 20 minutes
benny feilhaber also had a header ricochet off the post in the 88th minute but the hosts held firm to condemn the americans to a fourth defeat in 10 matches in the final round of qualifying"

the couple from west virginia had gone to las vegas for a weekend getaway and to attend the route 91 harvest music festival theyd dined out and swum in a gleaming hotel pool documenting their adventures on social media
just before the concert sunday night denise burditus grinned as she leaned in for a selfie with her husband of 32 years
it would be one of their last photos together within hours shed be among 58 victims felled by a gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in modern us history
now tony burditus finds himself among survivors of the las vegas massacre who share a distinctive grief they watched helplessly as their loved ones perished amid the barrage of gunfire
she died in my arms
like most people at the country music concert tony and denise burditus first thought the rapid staccato that erupted during the show was fireworks
they just kept dancing
she asked me if it was gunfire i told her no tony burditus told cnns anderson cooper it was during the second burst that we knew and started trying to get out of there
even then the couple didnt realize the killer had opened fire from a hotel room 32 floors above them
had he known tony burditus said they might have taken a different route
i was leading her through the crowd i initially thought it was an attack from the ground he said i looked up and didnt see anything
when a bullet hit his wife a stranger helped move her to a safe spot away from where others were dropping to the ground someone else rode with them to the hospital in the back of a truck
all the while denise burditus a retired banking professional whod just gone back to college lay silently
she was unconscious from the time she was struck her husband said
about seven hours after his wife posted the preconcert photo as her profile picture tony burditus updated his own facebook status
it saddens me to say that i lost my wife of 32 years a mother of two soon to be grandmother of five in the las vegas shooting he wrote denise passed in my arms i love you babe
burditus planned to stay in last vegas until his wifes remains could be transported back to west virginia in the early hours of his sorrow hed experienced moments when he couldnt believe she was gone he said and had flipped through his phone and tablet glimpsing photos of her beaming grin
denise always had a smile on her face he said and denise never met a stranger
i hope he heard me
sonny melton had gone to the concert with his wife heather
when the gunfire exploded the registered nurse from tennessee quickly tried to steer her away from the mayhem
i started feeling the ricochet of the bullets on the ground heather melton recalled and i said to sonny lets get down and he said we cant get down well get trampled
just watched wife cant let shooter overshadow victims replay more videos must watch wife cant let shooter overshadow victims 0130
he grabbed her from behind as they fled then a bullet struck him
i felt him get shot in the back she said we fell to the ground and i just remember seeing people around me on the ground
heather melton tried to talk to her husband when he didnt respond she started cpr
people were yelling at me to get down and i kept feeling the shots around me she said and i was just screaming for somebody to help me
before sonny melton took his last breath his wife tried to say goodbye
i hope he heard me she said i went to the trauma room and hed already passed i kissed him and hugged him but i was quickly escorted out of there because there was more traumas coming in
i just sat next to him

they just kept snapping photographs as the blasts multiplied
we heard it again and he looked back and it went through his neck mackinnon said of murfitt we didnt know what was going on yet he fell backward there was a big gush out of his neck
instead of running mackinnon lay down next to murfitt and put pressure on his neck a doctor and a fireman joined him and tried to stop the bleeding

"__label__real seoul reuters in the seaside city of wonsan north korean families cook up barbecues on the beach go fishing and eat royal jelly flavor ice cream in the summer breeze for their leader kim jong un the resort is a summer retreat a future temple to tourism and a good place to test missiles
he is rebuilding the city of 360000 people and wants to turn it into a billiondollar tourist hotspot at the same time he has launched nearly 40 missiles from the area as part of his accelerated tests of north koreas nuclear deterrent
it may sound crazy to outsiders to fire missiles from a place he wants to develop economically but thats how kim jong un runs his country said lim eulchul an expert on the north korean economy at kyungnam university in south korea
this combination of tourism and nuclear weapons is emblematic of kim jong uns strategy for survival say researchers and people familiar with the project
north koreas development plans for wonsan have mushroomed since they were first announced in 2014 examined here in detail for the first time they run across 160 pages in nearly 30 brochures produced by the wonsan zone development corporation in korean chinese russian and english in 2015 and 2016
tourism is one of a shrinking range of north korean cash sources not targeted by united nations sanctions and the brochures advertise to foreign investors some 15 billion worth of potential ventures in the wonsan special tourist zone an area covering more than 400 square km 150 square miles kim has already constructed a ski resort and a new airport there
according to one brochure the zone includes approximately 140 historical relics 10 sand beaches 680 tourist attractions four mineral springs several bathing resorts and natural lakes and more than 33 million tons of mud with therapeutic properties for neuralgia and colitis
the projects that kim is inviting investors to help build include a 73 million department store a 197 million city center development and a 123 million golf course including a 625 million fee to lease the land
earlier this year kim sent 16 of his officials to spain to get ideas for wonsan they visited marina dor one of the mediterranean countrys biggest holiday complexes and the terra mitica mythical land theme park in benidorm terra mitica caters to fans of extreme sensations according to its website
they saw such places with their own eyes and filmed some of them said a spokesman at the north korean embassy in madrid both parks confirmed the visits a spokeswoman for terra mitica said the north koreans were impressed by its themes including the ancient civilizations of egypt greece and rome
no major foreign partner has said they will back kims wonsan projects the new airport completed in 2015 has yet to open to international flights america recently banned its citizens from visiting north korea international sanctions now ban all joint ventures with the state
even so the plan is strategically vital for kim say former north korean diplomats when he came to power in 2011 he inherited a society officially run by the military but whose people survived largely on black market dealings on paper north korea is a staterun economy but in fact seven in 10 north koreans depend on private trade to live according to thae yong ho north koreas former deputy ambassador in london who staged a highprofile defection with his family in 2016
kim is perceived by outsiders as all powerful but north koreas free marketeers make him more vulnerable than he seems thae told reuters the leader is looking for a way to harness both military and market forces to survive
nuclear weapons are one part of his answer because kim hopes they will cost less to maintain than north koreas conventional heavy weapons projects like wonsan are the other part he wants to cut the share of funding he gives to the military and allocate more money to the civilian economy
kim jong un knows that he can only control society and guarantee his long leadership if his role and influence in the economy is increased said thae
friendly
north korea wants to attract more than 1 million tourists every year in the near term and around 5 million to 10 million tourists in the foreseeable future the wonsan brochures say the wonsan zone development corporation the north korean state body which oversees the project did not respond to requests for comment
there are no uptodate statistics on current visitors to north korea china said more than 237000 chinese visited in 2012 but it stopped publishing the statistics in 2013 for comparison 8 million chinese visited south korea in 2016
the korea maritime institute a thinktank in the south estimates that tourism generates about 44 million in annual revenue for north korea about 08 percent of the countrys gdp about 80 percent of all north koreas foreign tourists are chinese it says westerners and russians make up the rest
related coverage north koreas unhappy mix of tourists and military
the wonsan brochures are welcoming officials and residents of this zone have a good understanding of tourism and are friendly toward tourists one says
the brochures also disclose some unusual details about vacation habits in the totalitarian state
not far from the proposed 123 million golf course the plans show an existing compound it is labeled in the brochure as the summer retreat of the state security department or bowibu the entity which runs north koreas six prison camps and conducts nationwide surveillance of ordinary citizens
just next door to that beachfront property the daesong general bureau the body also known as office 39 that procures luxury goods for the kim family has its retreat
a third compound is reserved for the korean national insurance corporation a state insurance company that the european union says is involved in insurance fraud
all three entities are subject to international sanctions because of their role in funneling cash into kims nuclear and missile programs
for kims security forces though wonsan is about more than fun in the sun
kim brought his top military brass to wonsan in 2014 on the white sandy beach of his palace compound he ordered his highest admirals to strip into bathing costumes and as a test of their ability swim 10 km around the bay state tv showed it filmed him at a desk on the sand shaded by a white parasol
in april this year kim used the beach near wonsans new airport to unleash an artillery drill described by state media as the countrys largest ever in it 300 largecaliber selfpropelled guns opened fire at a white target painted on a small island 3 km away
the bombardment broadcast on state tv turned that island into a dusty moonscape

wonsan holds symbolic power for the kim dynasty it was there that kim jong uns grandfather kim il sung who helped found north korea at the end of japanese colonial rule in 1945 first landed with soviet troops to take over the country
statues of north koreas two former leaders stand on the quayside where tourists are expected to bow and buy plastic flowers to offer them next door to the kim family palace the songdowon childrens camp has welcomed young pioneers from sovietbacked countries for decades according to state media
when the young kim was picked as heir to kim jong il in 2009 he had few achievements to his name noted kim younghui who heads a team of north korea researchers at korea development bank in seoul if he can develop wonsan the place where his grandfather helped bring north korea into existence it will seal his image as a master builder
he has strong political reasons to develop wonsan she said she is a native of the city and defected to south korea in 2002
people from wonsan even those who have defected say they have largely happy memories of the place wonsans karaoke bars and billiard clubs have a more reliable supply of electricity than much of north korea they say they recall young couples roller skating in a big square near the wonsan waterfront
the city has a special place in kims heart says michael spavor a canadian consultant who shared long island iced teas with kim on board one of his private boats in 2013 after they had been jetskiing in the bay
he told me about redeveloping and improving the whole city for the people and attracting international tourists and businessmen to the area said spavor who runs the paektu cultural exchange which conducts economic research in north korea
no belttightening
official history has not disclosed kims birthplace but many people from wonsan believe he was born there partly because he spent his early years at the palace
slideshow 29 images
an anecdote from that time gives a flavor of life inside the kim family residence one day the japanese family chef kenji fujimoto recounted in his memoirs the future leader made an unusual remark
hey fujimoto a young kim said to the chef we ride horses every day go rollerblading play basketball and in the summer we jet ski or play in the pool but how do ordinary people live fujimoto who published the book in 2010 now runs a sushi restaurant in pyongyang and could not be reached
for years under kim jong il north korea backed by the soviet union and china had officially provided everything for its people
the political model then was known as songun military first which held that the korean peoples army was the first in line for resources and the infallible provider to fix the countrys economic problems the millionman army would swap kalashnikovs for shovels and set to work building roads dams and housing
after the soviet union collapsed in the 1990s the entire nation then 21 million people suffered a famine that kim jong il was eventually to call the arduous march the state was no longer able to provide food or work between 200000 and three million people died
to survive ordinary people were forced to look beyond the marshaled ranks on display at parades and hustle for scraps on private markets bribing officials to turn a blind eye to any illegality for most people including the military it was hunger or trade
when kim the younger came to power he said the time had come to enable our people to live without tightening their belts any longer
in 2013 he shifted the political rhetoric his policy line called byungjin or parallel development harked back to his grandfathers era it also signaled the sidebyside advance of north koreas nuclear deterrent and a strong economy
make money in wonsan
the latest available figures say north korea spends a bigger share of its gdp on the military than any country in the world an average of 23 percent between 2004 and 2014 according to the us state department
the wonsan brochures promise healthy profits including internal rates of return of between 14 percent and 43 percent the 73 million wonsan department store for example allows for foreign investors to hold a stake of up to 613 percent in return it says investors can expect to make 13 million net annual profit
the brochures offer preferential conditions for foreign investors saying their rights are protected by the state and they can remit funds abroad without any limitations land is available to them to lease not to own for 50 years but investors can trade the leases
some of the projects are less generous one offers the opportunity to cash in on the popularity of north korean beer with an initial 24 million investment in a new wonsan brewery the proposal says foreign investors will be subject to a 15 percent transaction tax a city management tax an auto tax plus other deductions then there is income tax at 14 percent these deductions will nearly halve the projected annual profit to 154711
for domestic investors north korea officially has no tax but experts say the state raises funds by collecting about 70 percent of the profits of state enterprises
a few of the proposals stretch the idea of tourism they include an offshore farm to produce seafoods of great economic value on an industrial basis so as to satisfy the demands of tourists and export the products to the foreign market a lighting factory a furniture factory and a renovated wonsan fishing tackle factory its output will include 10000 deep sea floats 750 tonnes of ropes and 2500 lifesaving jackets for swimming
since the plans were drawn up the united nations has tightened sanctions on north korea to include a ban on seafood exports and curbs on joint ventures
according to a brochure from 2015 foreign investor interest in the wonsan project was growing day by day
but a westerner who attended an investment conference in wonsan in 2015 said north korean officials showed little understanding of investors needs about 200 people chinese and westerners heard about investment prospects in the zone and were taken on a tour of the area
i thought i might be a witness to some actual pragmatism said simon cockerell of beijingbased koryo tours but they simply went on about how amazing the opportunities were and couldnt admit any weaknesses or that there may be any issues at all with the area or any of their plans
han jinmyung a north korean diplomat who was stationed in vietnam until 2015 before defecting to south korea said he had been tasked with promoting the wonsan scheme abroad and had little success we just ended up selling north korean herbs and medicines instead"

northern ireland lost in norway in their final world cup group game after their place in the playoffs for russia 2018 was confirmed by scotlands draw in slovenia prior to kickoff in oslo
a chris brunt own goal in the second half gave the norwegians the victory
ni are assured of being one of the best eight runnersup from the nine groups in the european qualifying series
but the defeat is a blow to their hopes of being one of the four seeded teams for the playoffs draw on 17 october
the four highest ranked countries in the fifa rankings issued on 16 october will be seeded with either portugal or switzerland already certain to be one of those teams depending on which of them finishes second in group b
northern ireland currently hold their highest ever position in the standings 20th but are likely to slip down the rankings following their losses to germany and norway in their last two group c qualifiers
scotlands 22 draw with slovenia earlier on sunday took some of the pressure off michael oneills men before their game but this defeat could deal a blow to their hopes of reaching a first world cup finals since 1986 through the route of the playoffs
brunt own goal gives norway victory
for norway this was their eighth win over northern ireland in 10 meetings and avenged their 20 reverse in belfast in march
the only goal of the game came in the 71st minute when goalkeeper michael mcgovern could only get one hand to stefan johansens cross from the left and brunts attempted clearance flew into the net
the visitors had chances to equalise but stuart dallas rightfooted shot was pushed wide by orjan nyland who also denied conor mclaughlin while substitute george saville drove an effort over the bar
saintetienne forward alexander soderlund sidefooted a rightfoot effort into the net deep into stoppage time and appeared unfortunate to have his goal ruled out by a late offside flag
northern ireland had not scored a firsthalf goal in a competitive away match since drawing 11 with finland in the final fixture of their euro 2016 qualifying campaign and rarely looked like ending that sequence during a tepid first half
steven davis twice tested nyland while at the other end birger meling saw a rightfoot drive pushed away by mcgovern and the norwich stopper also saved well from johansen
josh magennis attempts to launch an attack for northern ireland
oneill gambles with players on yellow cards
ni manager michael oneill named his strongest team for the game despite six key players being one yellow card away from a suspension which would rule them out of the first leg of the playoffs to be staged over two legs between 9 and 14 november
jonny evans steven davis corry evans oliver norwood stuart dallas and josh magennis were all on one caution going into sundays match but all avoided being booked
all six were named in oneills starting lineup although norwood winning his 50th cap was replaced at halftime by millwall midfielder george saville while corry evans came off in the second half
ni unable to add to tally of wins
northern ireland went into the game having won six games in the campaign more than any other previous world cup qualifying competition but they were unable to add to that tally as they bid to clinch a place at successive major tournament finals for the first time
the men in green had won their last two away qualifiers against azerbaijan and san marino but a third success on their travels for the first time in their history proved beyond them
group winners germany maintained their 100 record by beating azerbaijan 51 on sunday with secondplaced northern ireland finishing 11 points behind the defending champions following their third reverse of the campaign
the czech republic defeated san marino 50 to seal third place in the group four points behind ni but two ahead of norway and five in front of azerbaijan
we cant be greedy
northern ireland manager michael oneill the main thing was to get through without suspension and now we have two massive games in november
we cant be greedy well be up against some great teams and well have to deal with whatever comes
you may play a good team if youre seeded its unlikely we will be seeded but we still have a chance to get to russia
were punching above our weight and have done for a long time the squad has been stretched so the players deserve credit
norways hold over ni the stats"

they have also charred around 170000 acres 69000 hectares of land and destroyed some 3500 buildings since
while their cause has not been conclusively determined they are thought to have been sparked by power lines toppled by gale force winds and fanned by hot dry diablo winds that blew into northern california toward the pacific
new advisory evacuations were also issued in sonoma county late on wednesday for parts of santa rosa the largest city in the states worldrenowned wine country and geyserville an unincorporated town of 800 people

the 23 recorded deaths make the fires the deadliest in the state since 1991 with tubbs which has accounted for 13 fatalities the worst single blaze since 2003 according to state data
in addition to high winds the fires have been stoked by an abundance of thick brush left tinder dry by a summer of hot dry weather

washington reuters puerto rican governor ricardo rossello on monday ordered an investigation into water distribution on the hurricanebattered island and warned there would be hell to pay for mishandling of supplies
rossello said drinking water supplies have been restored to nearly 60 percent of the island but some areas in the north remained at around 20 percent nearly three weeks after hurricane maria hit the us territory
the government was delivering food and water supplies to municipalities but people in some areas said they were not receiving them from local authorities
rossello told a news briefing in san juan he ordered an investigation of water distribution after receiving complaints
if we are indeed getting several hundred thousand liters of water and several hundred thousand portions of food to the municipalities yet some people in those municipalities are claiming that theyre not seeing anything be delivered or they dont know where to find food then its important that we investigate why this is happening he said
the contents of a damaged home can be seen near the town of comerio reuterslucas jackson
the distribution of supplies including food water and fuel has been a major challenge for the struggling government after maria wiped out its power grid flooded roads and crippled the communications system
he said the government was trying to identify problems in the distribution pipeline and looking to ensure that local leaders deliver resources as soon as they arrive in a municipality

the governor said national guard troops and auditors were helping to determine what was occurring
if there is a place a locality that is not delivering food to the people of puerto rico that need it theres going to be some hell to pay rossello told cnn earlier monday
three weeks after the storm hit puerto rico still has a long road to recovery having only 15 percent of electrical power restored and struggling to regain communication services the white house has asked congress for 29 billion in hurricane relief for puerto rico texas and florida
the federal governments waiver of the jones act for puerto rico will not be extended after it expires on sunday night a department of homeland security official said on monday the act limits shipping between us coasts to us flagged vessels and can drive up the cost of goods

"__label__real mexico city reuters mexican officials warned on thursday that us proposals in ongoing nafta negotiations would result in protectionism and higher prices rather than free trade as concerns about the future of the deal helped drag the peso to fourmonth lows
negotiators from canada mexico and the united states are due to begin a fourth round of talks to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement nafta in washington next week
senators from president enrique pena nietos institutional revolutionary party pri said they would oppose any deal that included proposals such as setting a national quota for usmade auto parts and increasing controls over the trade in fresh produce people close to the talks said
we are deeply worried by what the us has added recently in the freetrade negotiations said senator marcela guerra who heads mexicos senate committee on north american affairs
us president donald trump argues that nafta has hollowed out us manufacturing sending jobs to mexico and fueling a us goods trade deficit of more than 60 billion with its southern neighbor
senator ricardo urzua said such proposals would hurt consumers who have enjoyed lower prices under nafta
far from trying to favor certain us labor sectors this would hurt millions of consumers in the united states canada and mexico urzua said
a lack of substantive progress in three rounds of nafta talks since august and concerns about the hardline us positions has added to market jitters in recent days
the peso currency closed down 129 percent at 184995 per dollar on thursday the lowest since june 5 also weighing solid us economic data broadly lifted the dollar as investors bet the federal reserve will raise interest rates in december
guerra mentioned six socalled red lines for mexico including a proposal by us commerce secretary wilbur ross to incorporate a sunset clause that would automatically kill nafta unless it was renegotiated every five years
mexicos economy minister ildefonso guajardo accused trump of seeking a protectionist war that would unravel the treaty that has helped expand annual trade to 1 trillion between the three nations
in an interview published in the el economista daily on thursday guajardo who leads the negotiations for mexico said the united states was considering trying to impose restrictions on companies that do business with stateowned entities
ending state oil firm pemexs 75year monopoly mexico opened up its oil and gas sector to private investment with a 201314 reform attracting investment from around the world
some critics believe staterun companies are subsidized creating an unlevel playing field however guajardo said it would be unacceptable for nafta to change the rules for companies doing business with pemex under the reform
imagine what exxon and all those who have bet on the reform and have established joint investments are going to think guajardo said in the interview

"__label__real european unions chief brexit negotiator michel barnier holds a joint news conference with britains secretary of state for exiting the european union david davis unseen on progress in this weeks latest round of negotiations on britains withdrawal from the european union belgium september 28 2017 reutersfrancois lenoir
brussels reuters european union negotiators see no big breakthrough in a new round of brexit talks from monday nor when theresa may attends a summit next week yet leaders could offer the beleaguered british prime minister a hand eu officials believe
talks which began on monday in brussels have a thin schedule british brexit secretary david davis is to meet eu negotiator michel barnier on tuesday and again on thursday but wednesday is blank on the timetable and officials will not touch on the knottiest outstanding problem how much britain pays the eu
that all but rules out miracles on key divorce issues that barniers boss says are needed for mays 27 fellow eu leaders to agree to open the talks she wants on a postbrexit free trade pact when they all meet in brussels next thursday and friday
the prime minister revived an increasingly sour dialogue two weeks ago by offering concessions in a speech in florence but talks that followed left big gaps on three core issues on which the eu demands significant progress before barnier can so much as mention what happens after britain leaves in 18 months time
yet such is the opposition to compromise that may faces within her own party that many eu diplomats think leaders could give her some hope at the summit to help her face down calls for britain to simply walk out without a deal an eventuality that the europeans are nonetheless preparing for
my guess is the leaders will try to find some positive elements one senior diplomat told reuters saying may could be offered hope of a landing zone for accords to let the next scheduled summit in middecember approve trade talks
this week could see further movement on agreeing rights for expatriate citizens where the role of eu judges is in dispute but few see much movement on the irish border or on the money
and with may and the eu batting back and forth assertions that the ball is in the others court attention is fast turning from this weeks meetings to next weeks summit
britains secretary of state for exiting the european union david davis l and european unions chief brexit negotiator michel barnier talk to the media ahead of brexit talks in brussels belgium september 25 2017 reutersfrancois lenoir
encouragement for may
not one of over a dozen senior eu officials and diplomats who spoke to reuters expect the summit to launch talks on future trade few rule out that mays counterparts may give her some assurance of doing so soon and even offer some limited exploration of the transition period she has asked for
she is in a difficult situation if she goes out there and there is nothing tangible on our side a senior eu official said saying governments wanted to keep up momentum for a deal that would avoid legal chaos across europe well try to be neutral maybe even offer an encouraging line to stay engaged
nonetheless governments are extremely wary of any attempt by british negotiators to divide their solid display of unity and are anxious not to appear to be going soft on may despite some sympathy for the balancing act she faces
on friday envoys from many of the 27 including heavyweights germany and france opposed suggestions from barnier that they might start some preliminary discussion of what exactly will happen in the transition period immediately after brexit
this situation is not a reason for the commission to loosen its guidelines a senior official from a big eu power said of mays domestic woes i believe she really wants a deal but we cant alter our negotiating stance because of that
nonetheless several diplomats said leaders could soften the stance on transition talks by next week leaders say they will not negotiate directly with may and want to channel everything through barnier but mays powerful peers may find it hard to sit back and watch her fail provoking further british turmoil
the leaders want to lead they want to make history said another senior eu diplomat who said the summiteers could break next week from the advice of their own officials who can say that they wont just say ok lets just get on with it

the more investigators delve into the life of mass murderer stephen craig paddock the stranger it gets first we discover that his father was a bank robber wanted on the fbis most wanted list paddock himself supposedly took illegal drugs and collected over 43 weapons he had stashed in his three homes and was a wealthy accountant and real estate investor the las vegas shooter was also hooked on gambling playing upwards of 1000 hands of video poker in a single hour at a cost of 100000
stephen paddock bet colossal sums by playing 125 a time hands at ferocious speeds for eighthour stints in casinos on the strip and in reno top video poker players told dailymailcom that players like paddock look like stenographers on the machines because their fingers move so fast they had seen paddock at exclusive vip tournaments in las vegas where he won and lost sixfigure sums
las vegas killer stephen paddocks brother once threatened to kill a friend in california tmz reported bruce paddock had been squatting in a san fernando valley home in 2014 when his friend hector cruz the owner accused him of tampering with machinery the website reported when cruz confronted him paddock allegedly said if you keep f with me i am going to kill you and drop you in the desert the 57yearold paddock also told cruz hit me like a man and punched his antagonist in one arm i am extremely afraid of paddock who has intimidated me by his violent character and destruction of my business office and my service bay cruz said in court papers according to the website
police have uncovered 47 firearms stashed across three locations by stephen paddock including within the hotel room inside his home and at another residence near reno nevada investigators found 12 rifles with modified bumpstocks in the hotel room along with thousands of rounds of ammunition a bumpstock is a fairly simple modification that enables a semiautomatic weapon to replicate the firing speed of an automatic weapon
american police say they have found no connection between stephen paddock and isis eric paddock the shooters brother explained stephen has no political affiliation no religious affiliation as far as we know this wasnt a terror attack
what does he mean it wasnt a terror attack just because the attacker wasnt an islamist doesnt mean it wasnt a terror attack terrorists come in all shapes sizes and races
the shooters girlfriend and roommate marilou danley has also been named as a person of interest in the fbi investigation according to a spokesman for the philippines national bureau of investigation danley arrived in the philippines a few weeks before the massacre unfolded the source added that there was a wire transfer to her account for 100000 from stephen possibly suggesting that danley had previous knowledge of the attack
danley returned to the us on tuesday for questioning however investigators have stated they do not believe she was involved in the crime
stephen paddock the accused shooter in the las vegas massacre was reportedly prescribed an antianxiety drug in june the las vegas reviewjournal reported the outlet reported the news after obtaining records from the nevada prescription monitoring program the records show paddock had been prescribed 50 10milligram diazepam tablets on june 21st according to the outlet the brand name for the drug is valium and it is a sedativehypnotic drug which can cause aggressive behavior when abused and trigger psychotic episodes those experiences are further amplified with alcohol
a retired fbi profiler jim clemente said in an interview that investigators may be able to prove if paddock had some kind of neurological disorder if his suicide did not destroy his brain
danley told investigators through her lawyer that she had no idea paddock was like that or capable of doing something like that and looked forward to them living a quiet life together on the other hand she said she remembers him exhibiting symptoms such as lying in bed and moaning according to two former fbi officials who have been briefed on the matter
the other former official said danley spoke about paddock displaying mental health symptoms but so far the fbi has not identified a clear motive said two fbi officials and they do not believe paddocks mental health had deteriorated to a point that would have triggered him to commit such an act
i dont buy her answer for one minute this is a woman born and raised in the philippines who later moved to australia where her sister lives she married two americans and was living with them at the same time before knowing paddock paddock told her to put the money he sent her down on a house to buy was he planning on moving there as an escape
when danley received a call from her brother informing her what paddock had done and that the police wanted to speak with her she replied dont worry i have a clear conscience and will take care of everything
lets parse this sentence tell him not to worry about what what does her having a clear conscience mean what does she mean by she will take care of everything now when she appears with her lawyer she acted so surprised and shocked islam has a strong presence in the philippines could it be she was a muslim who radicalized him there was lots of radical antifa literature all over one of his houses and antifa has aligned themselves with isis hence a possible isis connection by paddock
so were supposed to believe that a person whos not a gun guy has either expended untold thousands of dollars to legally purchase fullyautomatic weapons somehow found them on the black market or purchased and substantially modified multiple semiautomatic weapons and did so with enough competence to create a sustained rate of fire this same person also spent substantial sums purchasing just the right hotel room to maximize casualties i cannot think of another mass murderer who went to this level of expense and planning in the entire history of the united states

the coanchors colin jost and michael che both delivered pointed comic monologues that advocated for gun control
mr jost opened the segment by saying the investigation into the tragedy in las vegas this week has sparked a larger debate in america between people who want commonsense gun control and people who are wrong
he continued
this shouldnt be a partisan issue the guy had 47 guns no one should own 47 of anything if you own 47 cats you are not a responsible pet owner youre a crazy cat lady and unlike with guns the government will actually come and take your cats away because everyone agrees thats insane also this guy bought 33 of his guns in the past year and that didnt set off any kind of alert if i buy 100 worth of chickfila i get a text message from my bank that says did you just purchase 100 worth of chickfila please colin tell us this is fraud how is no one keeping track of how many guns people own there is a real law in texas that says its illegal to own more than six dildos and i get why no one needs that many if you have more than six dildos its a clear sign you are training for something awful
mr che asked why is it so hard to get gun control in this country his monologue continued
who are these delicate snowflakes that we cant just tell no youre not allowed to have 40 guns anymore earl from now on you can have one gun max and six bullets if you cant hit what youre shooting with six bullets then you dont need to be shooting at it learn karate or use your words im sick of this narrative that americans just love guns so much its not true seventyeight percent of americans dont even own a gun and 3 percent of americans own 50 percent of all the guns in the country thats the problem that whiny 3 percent that needs to feel secure all the time thats why i think we should do a buyback program for every gun you trade in we give you one halfinch of penis enlargement thats fair if you trade in 10 guns you get five more inches and if women want to trade in their guns dont keep your guns youre probably going to need it to fight off all those men in spandex showing off their brandnew eightinch penises

the demise of the us dollar has been a staple of the financial media for decades the latest buzzword making the rounds is dedollarization which describes the move away from usd in global payments
dedollarization is often equated with the demise of the dollar but this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the currency markets
look i get it the us dollar arouses emotions because its widely seen as one of the more potent tools of us hegemony lots of people are hoping for the demise of the dollar for all sorts of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual flow of currencies or the role of currencies in the global economy and foreign exchange fx markets
so there is a large builtin audience for any claim that the dollar is on its deathbed
i understand the emotional appeal of this but investors and traders cant afford to make decisions on the emotional appeal of superficial claimsnot just in the fx markets but in any markets
so lets ground the discussion of the demise of the usd in some basic fundamentals now would be a good time to refill your beveragedripbag because were going to cover some dynamics that require both emotional detachment and focus
first forget what currency were talking about if the usd raises your hackles then substitute quatloos for usd
there are three basic uses for currency
1 international payments this can be thought of as flow if i buy a load of bat guano and the seller demands payment in quatloos i convert my usd to quatloosa process that is essentially realtimerender payment and im done with the fx part of the transaction
it doesnt matter what currency i start with or what currency i convert my payment into to satisfy the selleri only hold that currency long enough to complete the transaction a matter of seconds
if sellers demand i use quatloos pesos rubles or rmb for those few moments the only thing that matters is the availability of the currency and the exchange rate in those few moments
2 foreign reserves nationstates keep reserves for a variety of reasons one being to support their own currency if imbalances occur that push their currency in unwanted directions
the only nations that dont need to hold much in the way of currency reserves are those that issue a reserve currencya socalled hard currency that is stable enough and issued in sufficient size to be worth holding in reserve
3 debt everybody loves to borrow money we know this because global debt keeps rising at a phenomenal rate in every sector government public corporate and household private sectors see chart below"

"__label__fake the experience of seeing the chicago bears play the pittsburgh steelers live
before its news
by bryan dietzler
this past sunday i had the opportunity to travel from my home in iowa to chicago to see the chicago bears play the pittsburgh steelers at soldier field while the game was hot the bears passing game was not and even though the game was discouraging at some points there are things the team can hang their hat on
and despite the oddities and inefficiencies the game was a real treat for me and so many other bears fans
if you werent at the game you might not have seen some of the things that you typically dont see on television one thing you didnt miss if you werent there was the extreme heat the temperature reached 95 degrees and the humidity was near 100 anyone who was in the sun the entire game had to be tired and dehydrated when it was over
the players on the field had to have been worn out after it was all said and done it was hot
lucky for this writer i was only in the sun for about a half an hour after that the rest of the game was very comfortable
the most frustrating thing about this game was the play of quarterback mike glennon and the bears receivers glennon does not throw take a snap or stand in the pocket well nor do his receivers adjust to his throws and of course drops are an issue
there is one major conclusion that can be drawn out of the performance of the offense on sunday and its simple glennon stinks he is so bad the bears dont even trust him to throw the ball thats why they ran the ball on so many offensive plays what the bears did is not a great way to win but its what they had to do and it was effective on sunday but it wont be effective that all the time
here is my fearless prediction
i believe that you will see mitchell trubisky after chicagos upcoming thursday night game against the green bay packers if glennon cannot throw the ball effectively or if the coaching staff wont let him throw it then they will start the rookie and let trubisky finish the season as the starter
if that happens you can bet that glennon will be gone at the end of the season
the most disappointing play of the game was marcus coopers fumble on his return of a blocked field goal at the end of the first half instead of taking care of business and just taking the ball into the end zone he started to slow down at about the tenyard line and began to showboat thats when disaster struck
pittsburgh steelers special teamer vance mcdonald came up behind cooper as he was taking his leisurely stroll towards the goal line and knocked the ball right out of coopers hands the ball was batted out of the end zone giving the officials one big mess to sort out
in the end chicago settled for three points when they could have had at least six that could have been the difference between winning and losing chicago was lucky that they won the game or that the three to four lost points werent the difference in a loss
hopefully someone on the coaching staff or a fellow teammate pulled cooper aside and let him have it after watching jordan howard run rampant all game and get up slowly three times it makes me wonder how much longer he will last the bears cannot afford to use him like they did sunday in the remaining 13 games of the season and they cant run tarik cohen that often either chicago must find their passing game and that may only come by starting the kid
there were standouts like howard sherrick mcmannis and akiem hicks but there was one player that had a nice game and deserves a few words
that player is outside linebacker pernell mcphee
we know what mcphee went through some tough times to start the 2017 season but has begun to bounce back positively on sunday he had one sack to go with three tackles and looked quick he wasnt limping around with his hands on hips like he was last season mcphee looked young fresh and fast
thats encouraging
injuries did happen in this game and will affect how things shake out with the bears shortly strong safety quintin demps broke his forearm and will be out indefinitely offensive lineman hroniss grasu suffered a hand injury while josh sitton sat out the game rookie tight end adam shaheen left the field with an apparent arm injury but he did return
and of course there was howard who looked like he was hurting throughout the whole game but he just kept on going
injuries have hurt the bears a lot this season and they keep happening they cannot afford to have that many more or else they will suffer the same fate as they did last year their rebuilding effort will be derailed and fans will be upset
i know you cant control injuries but the bears appear to be cursed when it comes to them
the game was one of the most emotional games this writer has ever attended at soldier field it was up and down all game it was full of mistakes replays and penalties there were some great moments great plays and a lot of strong individual efforts by several bears players
but in the end it was fun and so well worth the trip
while it may not have appeared to be a strong effort by the bears it was a win and thats what matters most getting that first win meant a lot to the team and their fans
before i close there is one more thing that i wanted to say about this game
sunday the stadium was filled with pittsburgh steelers fans while this game was a home game for the bears the steelers fans were just as loud and anxious as the bears fans were
every single steelers fan i met sat by or talked to was courteous and helped make the experience even better
it was truly a great experience and a great bears game
note i would like to thank the two people that sat in front of me at the game they were a couple from canada who were half steelers and half bears fans
you made it a great experience

taipei reuters president tsai ingwen vowed on tuesday to defend taiwans freedom and democracy amid growing pressure from giant neighbor china using a national day speech to warn that the selfruled island would not bow to pressure
china considers proudly democratic taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control
relations with beijing have deteriorated sharply since tsai who leads the proindependence democratic progressive party took office last year with china suspecting she wants to push for the islands formal independence a red line for beijing
china has cut off a regular dialogue mechanism with taiwan ramped up military drills around the island and stepped up international pressure to limit taiwans diplomatic footprint
tsai who has pledged to maintain peace with china said her government was still seeking breakthroughs in ties with beijing and promised consistent and stable policies
we need to remember democracy and freedom were rights obtained through all of taiwan peoples countless efforts tsai said
therefore we need to use all our power to defend taiwans democratic and freedom values and lifestyle she said
tsais speech came a week before china holds its twiceadecade communist party congress where president xi jinping who has taken a robust approach to territorial disputes in the east and south china seas will cement his grip on power

harvey weinstein the oscarwinning film producer accused of sexually harassing female employees has been fired by the board of his company
one of the biggest producers in hollywood mr weinstein was behind films including shakespeare in love the kings speech and pulp fiction
the weinstein company directors said that in light of new information about misconduct his employment had been terminated effective immediately
mr weinstein had been informed
his sudden departure comes after the new york times published a report last week about sexual harassment claims dating back nearly three decades
the 65yearold apologised and said he planned to take a leave of absence
the way ive behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain and i sincerely apologise for it mr weinstein said
however he later disputed the report which said he had reached at least eight settlements with women and vowed to take legal action
speaking up
mr weinstein is one of the most powerful men in hollywood having cofounded the miramax and weinstein company production firms
the allegations against him according to the new york times report emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities ashley judd and rose mcgowan
among the accusations levelled against the film producer are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked in return for sexual favours he promised to help advance their careers they said
president donald trump said on saturday he was not at all surprised by the revelations about mr weinstein a major backer of democratic candidates
many democratic lawmakers have since vowed to give their contributions from mr weinstein to charity mr trump faced his own sex scandal last year when video emerged of him using lewd language to describe groping women
image copyright getty images image caption weinstein has two children with wife georgina chapman
mr weinstein who is married to english fashion designer georgina chapman formed the miramax production house in the late 1970s with his brother and then sold it to disney
the pair went on to create the weinstein company and produce such hits as django unchained lion and the butler
the weinstein company statement was issued on sunday by the firms allmale board bob weinstein lance maerov richard koenigsberg and tarak ben ammar
mistakes
his departure leaves control of the company in the hands of his brother bob weinstein and chief operating officer david glasser
actress rose mcgowan called on the weinstein board to resign immediately over the allegations
men in hollywood need to change asap she told the hollywood reporter hollywoods power is dying because society has changed and grown and yet hollywood male behaviour has not
feminist author naomi wolf said his sacking was a landmark in penalties for this kind of eruption of testimony against a powerful man
last week mr weinsteins lawyer lisa bloom said that he denied many of the allegations made against him as patently false
he has acknowledged mistakes he has made said ms bloom he is reading books and going to therapy he is an old dinosaur learning new ways
but on saturday ms bloom said in a tweet that she was no longer advising mr weinstein
i have resigned as an advisor to harvey weinstein the tweet said my understanding is that mr weinstein and his board are moving to an agreement"

"__label__real tepic mexico thomson reuters foundation a debate about feminism with an allmale panel at mexicos biggest university is under fire on social media for its lack of women although the panel moderator says it was an attempt at portraying mens roles
the panel led by feminist and anthropologist marta lamas and featuring 11 men discussing feminism rights and the market has been criticized online as feminism for dummies and prompted one participant to drop out
set for oct 11 the event is entitled marta lamas in dialogue with xy a reference to male chromosomes
online critics called it a case of mansplaining when men condescendingly tell women about topics that they do not need explained
because theres nobody better to talk about feminism than a man said one twitter user
what next asked another on twitter a conference of atheists talking about religion carnivores talking about veganism communists talking about capitalism
lamas said the event was misinterpreted and meant as homage to her work on her 70th birthday while recognizing the role of men in improving the position of women
since ive been having conferences and meetings with women for about 48 years i said well its really something fresh and different she told the thomson reuters foundation
the idea to put xy instead of men was sense of humor she added it was a wink of the eye
lamas said she had not chosen the panelists for the national autonomous university of mexico unam event and was taken aback by the vehement reaction on social media
one panelist journalist jenaro villamil said on twitter he was pulling out im not interested in continuing this game of hate he wrote
feminism can be a controversial topic in mexico where machismo is strong and violence against women is common roughly 650 women were murdered in mexico in the first six months of this year according to the national citizen observatory a civil group that monitors justice and security
feminist activist veronica vidal degiorgis said outcry over the panel showed differences over whether to involve men in talk of improving the lives of women
if something good comes out of this its how we can have more engagement on moving the agenda forward degiorgis told the foundation men also have the right to be involved in some point in how to dismantle the patriarchy as theyre part of it"

under narendra modi the worlds thirdbiggest oil consumer is trying to use its market size to strike better deals with oil exporters and attract investment into indias exploration and refining industries reutrs2kxqxui
executives from companies including rosneft bp exxon mobil reliance industries saudi aramco royal dutch shell vedanta schlumberger and halliburton met modi as the industry gathered in new delhi for the threeday india energy forum which finishes on tuesday

subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy contract frameworks and arrangements requirement of seismic data sets encouragement for biofuels improving gas supply setting up of a gas hub and regulatory issues came up for discussion
the statement said that many suggestions at the last meeting in 2016 have helped guide indian policymaking and that modi said he appreciated the focused suggestions made this year and that scope for reform in many areas still exists
modi was quoted as saying he looked forward to various opportunities for cooperation between india and saudi arabia the second biggest oil exporter to the country behind iraq

smith who won his first pga title at the zurich classic team event in may picked up five shots on the way out and three more over the last five holes to stand a shot clear of thai poom saksansin and americans xander schauffele and keegan bradley
world number four justin thomas who has won the tournament for the last two years with a combined score of 49under left himself with some work to do in his quest for a threepeat after posting a twounder 70
hideki matsuyama who passed up the chance to defend his japan open title to play in malaysia this week is a spot above thomas in the world rankings and matched his score on thursday after mixing four birdies with two bogeys
schauffele who edged thomas by a stroke to win the tour championship in atlanta last month never looked back after opening with a birdie and then chippingin from off the green for another at his third hole
the 23yearold californian pga tour rookie of the year for 2017 picked up another five shots over the remaining 15 holes and suggested his errorfree 65 had been as much the result of avoiding the lush tropical rough as anything
it was boring which i guess is a good thing out here he said

"__label__fake the chicago bears versus the minnesota vikings indepth game preview
before its news
by bryan dietzler
the chicago bears fresh off a loss to division rival green bay will host the minnesota vikings in their only monday night appearance of the 2017 season the vikings are coming off a loss as well 147 at the hands of division rival detroit they are desperately looking for a win they come in with a record of 22 while the bears have won just one game this season
by now everyone knows that rookie quarterback mitchell trubisky will start monday night he replaces someone who could never quite do what the bears needed him to do in mike glennon the future is now and its time they start to move forward and with such a heavy investment in mitch its about time they did
with this game being trubisky s first start it will be a tough outing for the bears passing game it was already anemic and mistakeridden air attack anyway so why not move forward instead of keeping it in neutral that must have been what the bears decision makers thought when they decided to put mitch in
we wont talk about the bears pass offense rankings you can throw all that out now that trubisky is in the lineup the rookie will be facing the leagues 24th ranked pass defense so there will be some opportunities for them to pass the ball if they can get him going
and if mitch can throw the ball well hopefully his receivers will be there to not only catch it but hang onto it
mitch may want to rely on some of the teams strongest pass catchers their tight ends guys like zach miller and dion sims could help the rookie gain some comfort and they could be a safety outlet when the heat is on trubisky needs to find a receiver he can rely upon and one of the tight ends would be a great outlet for him to throw the ball too
when it comes to pass protection the vikings defense can get to the quarterback they have 11 sacks in four games and their leader in sacks is everson griffen with five griffen will present many problems for the bears offensive line he will be going up against the likes of charles leno jr who despite his critics is one of the better offensive left tackles in the game
leno will have his work cut out for him on monday night though
the secondary for the vikings has some great players in it there is bear killer safety harrison smith chicago fans know him all too well he and two other teammates have one interception a piece this season so trubisky better be wary of where harrison and those guys are if he finds them too often it will be a long night
the vikings do play well against the run coming into the game the vikings are ranked third in the league allowing 712 yards per game the bears must run the ball to win and they could find it difficult monday night but having all of their offensive linemen healthy and ready to go will go a long ways to ensuring that they can run the ball chicago will see some success running the ball against the vikings
remember last halloween
the bears rushing offense is gaining an average of 1175 yards per game which is 12th in the league the bears can win games on the ground so if they can run the ball well they can win but will the vikings let them
minnesotas best linebacker is anthony barr barr has recorded 26 total tackles this season and can make plays anywhere on the field the bears have to be wary of him taking care of barr who plays on the outside will be the job of either leno jr massie or a tight end when the bears run the ball
hopefully those blockers will be able to take him out of the picture and free up some running room
the will also need to worry about the vikings leading tackler strong safety andrew sendejo he can make plays in the secondary and will sneak up to play the run every blocker the bears have available on monday needs to be wary of those sendejo and the aforementioned smith they can dominate any game
going back to the passing game i dont want to sound like a broken record but the bears receiving corps is anemic there is no star in that group and no one has stepped up to be their number one wide receiver and with a rookie quarterback that makes his development even more difficult
aside from the tight ends and running is there any other receiver who can step up
the bears have gotten some good play out of their defense and they can help chicago win games if their offense can limit the mistakes
the defense has been rocked by injuries as the linebacker and safety groups have seen starters go down of course we all know that jerrell freeman is gone for the season and nick kwiatkoski is a few weeks away from coming back strong safety quintin demps will be out as also and now outside linebacker willie young has been added to the injured reserve list
danny trevathan will miss the game due to a suspension but even though the bears defense is hurting they can still play and play well
its not yet known who the bears will face at quarterback for the vikings at last check sam bradford was still a day to day decision case keenum has been a good game manager and had a nice game against the tampa bay buccaneers but chicago needs not to let him repeat that performance they can prevent that with a solid performance from their pass rushing defense
the bears pass defense is ranked 15th against the pass allowing 2208 yards per game minnesotas passing offense is gaining an average of 2632 yards per game which is 8th in the nfl the bears will have their work cut out for them but not knowing who will play quarterback makes it a little hard to prepare
the vikings receivers are pretty good adam thielen and stefon diggs are two very capable wide receivers diggs already has four touchdowns this season and is difficult to cover
the bears must shut him down
chicagos secondary has its slipups but overall they can be solid they have some strong players at the cornerback spot and use a threeman rotation to help keep things fresh prince amukamara kyle fuller and marcus cooper are the starters bryce callahan comes in as a nickel back and has done well this season
there is a lot of talent in this group
but the pass rush is the key component for making sure the vikings cant pass the ball all over the field chicagos defense currently has nine sacks this year their leaders there are pernell mcphee and willie young with two apiece when you compare that to the top team in the nfl in sacks which is jacksonville with 18 thats not great at all
the bears must get pass pressure on whoever the quarterback is for minnesota and now that willie young is out for the year rushing the passer will get tougher
chicagos most capable pass rushers are akiem hicks leonard floyd and pernell mcphee they will go up against an offensive line that has allowed just five sacks all season
getting a sack on monday night is going to be difficult for the bears but even if they cant get sacks they can hurry the quarterback and make him rush his throws that could help generate turnovers which the bears will desperately need to stay in this game
stopping the run hasnt been difficult for chicago theyve allowed just 855 yards through four games which is good for sixth in the nfl the vikings have rushed for 108 yards on average which is ranked 17th remember that their leading rusher cook is out for the year so facing a new running back may either be good or bad for chicago
when it comes to points scored per game minnesota is ranked 19th scoring 198 per game chicago is allowing a whopping 26 points per game which is ranked 27th the bears need to turn that around and start holding opponents to fewer points
maybe they can start against the vikings if they want to win they must that and this is the game to start a new trend
when it comes to special teams the bears have some trouble in the kicking game with connor barth their dissatisfaction with barth showed this week as they brought in some other kickers to try out however as this article is being written the bears have not signed a new kicker
barth is two of four on field goals this year which is disappointing compare that to vikings kicker kai forbath who has made all but one of his field goals this season six of seven the edge here goes to the vikings the problem is if the game comes down to a field goal kick the bears may not be able to win the game or trust barth to win it
thats unfortunate
the vikings leading kick return specialist is jerick mckinnon and he has a 261yard return average chicagos kick return teams are allowing an average of 175 yards per return they must not allow mckinnon or any other special teamer make a mockery of them on monday night
the team that plays the best on special teams may win the game as a mistake on special teams could help swing a close game in one teams favor
the bears leading kick return specialist is deonte thompson with a 233yard average minnesotas special teams are allowing 226 yards per return the numbers are even maybe the bears can get something going here
pat odonnell has been solid this season his average is 486 but the most important thing is that he has dropped eight punts inside the 20 the bears should be very comfortable with him punting the ball minnesotas special teams units feature marcus sherels who is averaging a lowly 56 yards per return the bears punt coverage teams which are allowing just 87 yards per return so they arent getting killed there
the vikings punter ryan quigley has a 427yard average with seven placed inside the 20 the bears punt return specialists are averaging 87 yards while tarik cohen leads the way with 78 yards per attempt chicago needs someone to break some long returns and either get good field position or get into the end zone
that will help them win this or any game
the coaching staffs for both teams are very experienced when it comes down to the head coaches and what they have to offer fox may have an advantage over vikings head coach mike zimmer in years being a head coach however zimmer is a smart coach who makes good decisions
they match up well with against one another
anytime these two teams get together the outcome is difficult to predict last year in their first game no one expected the bears to beat the vikings at that point minnesota was having a strong season while the bears were struggling like they are now but chicago derailed the vikings so anything is possible on any given day in any game between these two teams
this being mitchell trubiskys first start it will be a tough outing for the bears but i hope i am wrong every bears fan hopes that trubisky will be able to play a strong firstever game coupled with a strong rushing attack and opportunistic defense maybe he can help the bears win
but they wont win it it will be close but they will fall just short trust me there will be better days ahead for the bears

in a case that clearly highlights the manner in which police break the law to target arrest and convict citizens with impunity 77yearold charles frederick white has been sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for cultivating marijuana
the sheriffs office claims they happened upon the growing operation by mistake while ostensibly claiming to follow up on a call from a woman outside the baltimore area who said her identity had been stolen and that new credit cards taken out in her name were being sent to a polk county address
curiously the officers took four months from the time she called to allegedly investigate
it was just really hard to get in touch with them rianhard said of the polk county sheriffs office they just really didnt do a whole lot
rianhard said she doesnt know why it took four months after calling in december for sheriffs detectives to go out to the address of the supposed thief
she said she never knew that her identify theft case had accidentally spawned a major marijuana bust
its bizarre how that happened rianhard said
bizarre is likely a vast understatement with the truth likely being much closer to white being targeted by federal state and local law enforcement which used an absurd excuse to gain access to his property
the detectives claim that they were unable to find the home they were looking for in the rural area 45 miles north of springfield so they decided to stop at the nearest home that of charles frederick white who at the time was 71
from the outset law enforcement began violating whites rights as they drove up a long driveway to his home and parked the detectives immediately noticed the pungent skunklike smell of unharvested cannabis
from that point forward all investigation into the identity theft was abandoned
white approached the detectives who spoke to him for a few minutes before leaving a search warrant was then obtained and white was eventually charged with growing more than 1700 marijuana plants
the problem with this initial contact by the detectives is that white had a closed gate on his driveway with a posted no trespassing sign
of course the detectives claim that the gate was open and they never saw the sign although two neighbors testified in court saying they had lived next to white for years and he never left the gate open
one of the neighbors even testified that he saw officers approach the gate that day get out of their car undo the chain and open the gate
according to a report by springfield newsleader
whites attorneys have long argued that the case should have never reached a sentencing saying white has been unfairly targeted by local state and federal authorities authorities already had their eye on white long before march 2012 his attorneys say when overzealous detectives illegally stepped on his property and trampled his constitutional rights according to a motion filed by whites attorneys this case didnt begin with a maryland womans identity being stolen it began in a kansas city parking lot in 2010 court records show that a missouri state highway patrol sergeant observed white and another man leaving a hydroponics store and filling a pickup truck with plantgrowing equipment according to court filings white was the focus of a brief investigation details of that investigation were never passed onto the polk county sheriffs office the federal prosecutor said the discovery of more than 1700 marijuana plants on whites property authorities said was just luck
the detectives of course testified in court that they had never heard of nor met white before trespassing on his property in march 2012 and unsurprisingly also claimed to have not noticed the no trespassing as they trespassed onto his property
court records revealed that police twice went onto whites property prior to obtaining a search warrant
despite the neighbors testimony that they saw the detectives undo the chain and open the gate the federal judge in the case douglas harpool refused to suppress the evidence obtained from the clear violation of whites fourth amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure
finally after years of legal wrangling this week white now a 77yearold man with failing eyesight walked into the federal courtroom for sentencing with a cane in his hand and shackles around his ankles after accepting a plea deal in february of 2017
harpool said he didnt feel good about handing down a 10year prison sentence an elderly man over growing a plant that is legal in many states the judge claimed to have researched ways to give white a downward departure from the 10yearminimum federal prison sentence but was unable to find any legal rationale to justify it
this is not a sentence i feel particularly good about harpool said
showing the clear insanity of federal law a presentence report pegged the time white should serve in prison for his offense at 24 years in prison due to his past convictions for growing cannabis white was previously convicted in 1990 of growing more than 600 marijuana plants and in 2004 of cultivating more than 100 marijuana plants
under the terms of whites plea deal the federal prosecutor recommended the minimum sentence under us law 10 years in federal prison
friends and family who attended the sentencing hearing were dismayed that the case was never thrown out of court due to the clear violations of whites constitutional rights ie trespassing onto his personal property during the investigation
hes a good man hes always been happy and cheerful whites stepdaughter valerie patterson said hes never had a history of violence
robert murphy a friend said officers entered whites property unlawfully
hes a farmer hes always been a farmer murphy said when he was busted he was busted illegally
whites attorney suggested home confinement but the judge said that was not applicable in this case
judge harpool eventually sentenced white to 10 years in prison and said that he would recommend that the bureau of prisons consider a compassionate release for white
the fact that this man elderly man who has no history of violence is going to prison for 10 years over growing a plant shows the sheer insanity of federal cannabis law
sadly its likely that white will die in prison over simply farming a plant the us federal government bans but that over half of the us states have legalized medically with a growing number having legalized recreationally
please share this story to awaken others to how the insane war on marijuana destroys the lives of good people

"__label__fake player to watch regardless of his game 1 performance trevor bauer is what he is
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
its intriguing that the indians have tabbed trevor bauer as their game 1 starter despite having corey kluber and carlos carrasco available to them we all know bauer isnt the teams top option though the opportunity is certainly going to grab the attention of the masses once considered one of the top prospects in the game the question is if a strong start will be enough to get people buying the potential as opposed to reality
bauer continues to be nothing more than pedestrian in the majors having posted a 419 era and 137 whip in 17 it would be easy to point towards his strikeout rate 1000 k9 and poor luck 337 babip as a reason to believe but you need to dig a little bit deeper before jumping to that conclusion
while the strikeout rate was impressive the underlying marks dont seem to support it
92 swstr
251 oswing
its impossible to expect him to maintain the elevated mark despite his extensive repertoire he threw seven different pitches in 17 and consistency even if he goes out there and strikes out a ton of batters today with the spotlight shining brightly it is not going to change that opinion
then you have the consistently elevated line drive rate at 215 in 17 213 for his career sure the babip is still higher than wed expect but he owns a career 301 mark and that has helped to a 136 whip maybe he can get the mark down into the 128 type range but its a long shot and not a sexy number regardless
throw in some home run issues with a 128 hr9 118 or higher in two of the past three seasons and its easy to say that the outlook isnt all that impressive its intriguing that the indians have trusted him in game 1 but regardless of his performance nothing is going to change
his strikeout rate is likely to regress
he has proven to be a lackluster whip producer
he has struggled with home runs
does that sound like a pitcher to invest in one start shouldnt change things and bauer is at best a backend option but more of a late round flier for your bench and little more

"__label__real the logo of skoda is seen during the 87th international motor show at palexpo in geneva switzerland march 8 2017 reutersarnd wiegmann
prague reuters volkswagens czech carmaker skoda auto underscored its commitment to its home country on wednesday saying it was planning to add jobs there amid worries the business could lose some production to germany
skoda has become volkswagens vw second most profitable brand in terms of operating margin and is on target for record sales in 2017 but capacity is hitting a limit and its success is causing tensions inside the german car group
reuters reported last week that vw managers and unions were seeking to curb competition from lowercost skoda and move some of its production to germany raising worries among czech workers
skoda chief executive bernhard maier told reporters on wednesday the czech republic would remain skodas home and that it was adding jobs locally to meet capacity demands
skoda is running at the edge of its capacity which is evidence that our strategy is working he said
at the moment concerning global demand we are not able to cover it from the czech republic and for this reason we are looking around at other production capacities
maier added skoda had taken on 3000 workers in recent months and was planning to hire more to be able to cover rising demand he said skoda was in talks with unions about this
skoda sold a record 113 million vehicles last year
skoda and other industry players met on wednesday with government officials at a news conference prime minister bohuslav sobotka said skoda had assured him it would do the maximum not to jeopardize jobs
skodas czech union has warned any production shift could result in as many as 2000 lost jobs at skoda which employed 28000 at the end of 2016 excluding temporary staff
tensions between vws various carmaking brands are expected to rise ahead of a nov 17 supervisory board meeting due to approve annual investment budgets across the group
maier told staff in a letter seen by reuters last week that the czech unit would only make use of vws wider manufacturing network to cope with peaks in demand
as a matter of principle our czech factories are and will remain first choice maier said in the letter
the reuters report also cited sources as saying vw wanted the czech brand to pay more for shared technology asked about this on wednesday maier said he saw no reason for any change"

the international whistleblower coalition wikileaks who have had their sights on the cia pivoted their focus to russias own surveillance offering a look at technical details of how moscow spies on its citizens mobile data online
the 35 documents in the wikileaks spy files russia dump pertain to a st petersburgbased company called peterservice a software and technology vendor that contracts on russian government surveillance projects dated between 2007 and 2015 several of the documents describe how peterservice participates in russias digital surveillance operation known as system for operative investigative activities sorm
a lot of people try to uncover things about sorm andrei soldatov a russian journalist told wired so any new technicalities are good there is some surveillance equipment which is installed on the premises of telecoms and isps which is pretty well described because its produced by commercial companies we know pretty much all about those things what is a big mystery is whats going on on the end of the fsb not just in moscow but in every russian town because every local branch of the fsb has this equipment and is connected to the local isps
this latest release comes after countless baseless claims made by public figures and the mainstream media that wikileaks and its founder julian assange are influenced or controlled by the russian government as the organization has put a lot of focus on exposing us secrets
the alleged leak shows that peterservice is installing software infrastructure all over russia thanks to governmental approval which allows russian state agencies to spy on its citizens online and mobile activity
wikileaks stated
peterservice is uniquely placed as a surveillance partner due to the remarkable visibility their products provide into the data of russian subscribers of mobile operators which expose to peterservice valuable metadata including phone and message records device identifiers imei mac addresses network identifiers ip addresses cell tower information and much more this enriched and aggregated metadata is of course of interest to russian authorities whose access became a core component of the system architecture
former nsa whistleblower edward snowden who is living in russia and has previously criticized russia for its own spying on citizens chimed in tweeting plot twist wikileaks publishes details on russias increasingly oppressive internet surveillance industry
plot twist wikileaks publishes details on russias increasingly oppressive internet surveillance industry httpstcobpzkh5npik pictwittercomehxdw2zrdg edward snowden snowden september 19 2017
peterservice claims to already have access to a majority of all phone call records as well as internet traffic in russia wikileaks wrote one document revealed that the company has access to specific information about your phone and your online payments if you live in russia
under russian law service operators must maintain a data retention system drs that requires them to store data for up to three years
the peterservice drs system allows russian state agencies to query the database of all stored data to search for information such as calls made by a certain telephone company customer the payment systems used the cell that served the specific mobile the manuals published by wikileaks contain the images of the interfaces that allow agents to search within this huge trove of data so access is simple and intuitive wrote stefania maurizi on the italian media outlet la repubblica
according to wikileaks peterservices drs solution can handle 500000000 connections per day in just one cluster the system has high performance and the claimed average search time for subscriber relatedrecords from a single day is ten seconds
the data retention system is a mandatory component for operators by law it stores all communication metadata locally for three years state intelligence authorities use the protocol 538 adapter built into the drs to access stored information continues wikileaks
one of the systems in place covered in the wikileaks dump was referred to as traffic data mart records and monitors ip traffic for all cell phones registered with the company
the tdm maintains a list of categorized domain names which cover all areas of interest for the state these categories include blacklisted sites criminal sites blogs webmail weapons botnet narcotics betting aggression racism terrorism and many more
based on the collected information the system allows the creation of reports for subscriber devices identified by imeitac brand model for a specified time range top categories by volume top sites by volume top sites by time spent protocol usage browsing mail telephony bittorrent and traffictime distribution
wikileaks adds that the national providers are aggregating internet traffic in their infrastructure and are redirectingduplicating the full stream to dpigrid units the units inspect and analyse traffic the presentation does not describe that process in much detail the resulting metadata and extracted information are collected in a database for further investigation a similar yet smaller solution called mdhdrs is available for regional providers who send aggregated ip traffic via a 10gbs connection to mdh for processing
wikileaks also notes that the presentation was written just a few months after edward snowden disclosed the nsa mass surveillance program and its cooperation with private us itcorporations such as google and facebook
drawing specifically on the nsa prism program the presentation offers law enforcement intelligence and other interested parties to join an alliance in order to establish equivalent datamining operations in russia the group adds
its important to note that the wikileaks documents dont actually make any reference to russias spy agency the fsb instead they only make the attribution to state agencies
the detailed documents show a similar statefunded mass surveillance program to the ones utilized by the uss nsa and by gchq in the uk

"__label__real ambassador bass has our full backing not only here at the state department but also at the white house as well said heather nauert the department spokeswoman
the dispute began on sunday after a turkish employee of the united states consulate in istanbul was arrested and accused of having links to fethullah gulen the islamist cleric accused by the turkish government of orchestrating a failed coup last year
the consulate employee was the second to be detained this year a third is being sought and the police have questioned his family members according to turkish news reports
the american embassy dismissed the charges as baseless and in response temporarily stopped issuing visas to turkish citizens to travel to the united states while it assessed turkeys commitment to the security of american facilities and personnel
within hours the turkish foreign ministry announced similar measures in the united states adding that the suspension included electronic visas and visas bought at the border the way most tourists and other shortterm visitors enter the country
on tuesday turkey seemed to have suspended its electronic visa service for americans but officials said by early afternoon that no americans had been turned back since none had arrived without visas
the turkish government has been conducting a widespread crackdown under a state of emergency since the coup attempt in july 2016 arresting more than 50000 people and suspending 150000 for alleged links to the gulen movement it has also insisted on the need for wideranging investigations and purges to remove coup plotters and gulen supporters from government institutions

military officers politicians journalists academics and government workers have been caught up in the broad sweep as well as several dozen foreign citizens including 11 americans
western officials have accused mr erdogan of detaining foreign citizens as hostages or bargaining chips in order to secure the extradition of mr gulen who has been in selfimposed exile in pennsylvania since the early 1990s

political analysts say mr erdogan is also concerned about court cases in the united states against 15 of his bodyguards who are accused of attacking protesters in washington in may and a group including a former cabinet minister charged with conspiring to break iranian sanctions
adding to the tensions a turkish court on tuesday sentenced a reporter for the wall street journal to more than two years in prison over an article she wrote about the kurds the newspaper said the court deemed the article to be terrorist propaganda in support of a banned kurdish separatist organization
the conviction of the reporter ayla albayrak who holds dual turkishfinnish citizenship and is currently in new york highlights the increasing targeting of journalists in turkey the newspaper reported

this ruling against a professional and respected journalist is an affront to all who are committed to furthering a free and robust press said william lewis the chief executive of dow jones the newspapers publisher we call on those who share this commitment to make their voices heard
mr erdogan has used the attempted coup to rally political support and stir nationalist sentiment many of his supporters openly voice the suspicion that the united states had a hand in the plot and sought his downfall
mr erdogan said on tuesday that gulen followers had infiltrated the american consulate in istanbul and he questioned why the united states had tolerated them
how did these agents infiltrate into the american consulate he asked if these agents did not infiltrate the american consulate then who put them there we need to focus on them no state would allow such agents to threaten it from the inside

prime minister binali yildirim set an antiamerican tone in comments to party members during a weekly meeting in ankara
regarding the legal cases against the united states consulate employees he said so what is it a privilege to be in the us mission should we get permission from those gentlemen
the united states authorities had never asked for turkeys permission when they detained an officer of a turkish stateowned bank mr yildirim said he was referring to the arrest in new york of mehmet hakan atilla the deputy general manager of international banking at halkbank who is among those charged with conspiring to break sanctions on iran
mr yildirim called for the diplomatic dispute to be resolved swiftly through dialogue but he also seemed to be rubbing salt in the wounds of the relationship he told party members that around 80 percent of turkish people do not like the united states it had failed to cooperate with turkey in the aftermath of the coup attempt and continued to support kurdish fighters in syria against turkeys request he added
a survey conducted recently by the pew research group found that 72 percent of turkish citizens felt that american power and influence were a major threat to their country an increase of 28 percentage points since 2013
the american suspension of all nonimmigrant visas could affect over 100000 turkish citizens who travel to the united states annually but turkey is likely to suffer more roughly half a million americans business travelers and tourists visit turkey annually
but turkey seems to have dialed back on its initial announcements that all visas would be suspended customs and trade minister bulent tufenkci said that no american without a visa would be allowed to enter the country adding that none had tried so far the airport police confirmed that no americans had been turned back since none had tried to arrive without visas
trade would not immediately be damaged since a lot of commerce was conducted electronically these days mr tufenkci said
the world is getting smaller now he said everything is not connected to a visa"

you cant make this up the irs awarded equifax with a multimillion dollar fraud prevention nobid contract despite that its own execs committed market fraud when they sold shares before telling the public they were hacked
the irs will pay equifax 725 million to help verify taxpayer identities and prevent fraud under a nobid contract issued last week
the credit agency will verify taxpayer identity and assist in ongoing identity verification and validations at the irs according to the award
the award describes the contract as a sole source order which means equifax is the only company held capable of providing the service the order was issued to prevent a lapse in identity checks while officials resolve a dispute over a separate contract
both republican and democrat lawmakers bashed the irs decision as irresponsible and horrible
in the wake of one of the most massive data breaches in a decade its irresponsible for the irs to turn over millions in taxpayer dollars to a company that has yet to offer a succinct answer on how at least 145 million americans had personally identifiable information exposed senate finance chairman orrin hatch rutah told politico in a statement
the finance committee will be looking into why equifax was the only company to apply for and be rewarded with this i will continue to take every measure possible to prevent taxpayer data from being compromised as this arrangement moves forward sen ron wyden dore said
reps suzan delbene dwash and earl blumenauer dore also expressed their distaste for the deal writing letters to irs commissioner john koskinen demanding he explains why the agency awarded the contract to equifax as well as provide information on any alternatives they may have considered
i was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the onion until i realized this story was in fact true blumenauer wrote
the irs defended its decision in a statement stating that equifax told the agency that none of its data was involved in the breach and that equifax already provides similar services to the irs under a previous contract
following an internal review and an onsite visit with equifax the irs believes the service equifax provided does not pose a risk to irs data or systems the statement reads at this time we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the equifax breach but we will continue to closely monitor the situation
early last month equifax was hacked exposing the personal information of as many as potentially 150 million americans which included social security numbers birth dates and other private information
afterwards three executives sold off 18 million dollars of the companies stock before telling the public the justice department opened a criminal investigation into those three equifax executives
another fun fact the identity verification systems the irs uses are made by creditrating agency equifax the system known as knowledgebased authentication or kba asks questions based on a persons credit history such as on which of the following streets have you lived or what is your total scheduled monthly mortgage payment
if thats not enough quartz reports that in 2015 the equifax kba system was hacked in a data breach that resulted in the loss of more than 700000 tax records
former equifax ceo richard smith was put in front of congressional committee hearing this week and apologized for mistakes which led to the massive breach
smith additionally called for an end to social security numbers claiming the country needed to think beyond the identifiers
what is a better way to identify consumers in our country in a very secure way i think that way is something different than an ssn a date of birth and a name he said according to bloomberg
with two breaches under its belt including one involving an irs system can any person state one valid reason to give equifax a 725 million contract and tell me how on earth the firm is still seen as capable to do the job

"__label__fake the young white sox looking at yoan moncada others getting an opportunity
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
the white sox are a team playing for the future and they have been taking these final few weeks to analyze some of the younger players on their roster tim anderson has gotten a lot of the attention with a red hot september but hes not alone lets take a look at a few of the youngsters getting an opportunity and trying to decide if they have any appeal
yoan moncada second baseman
we all know the hype thats surrounded yoan moncada as well as the disappointment that hes been thats until recently as hes hitting 306 with 5 hr 11 rbi 16 r and 2 sb over 17 september games now the question is if hes finally figured something out or if this is nothing more than a flash in the pan
the big question has always been his ability to make contact and while hes improved in september its not like his 291 strikeout rate is going to impress anyone that said his whiff for the month shows a bit of promise
hard 882
breaking 1207
offspeed 3000
obviously theres still work to be done against offspeed pitches but his marks against other pitches brings hope that he can continue making contact and further improve his strikeout rate if thats the case theres little question that the power and speed plays and he should continue to be a productive option moving forward
it will be interesting to see how he closes out the season but ride the hot streak for now
adam engel outfielder
the youngster is getting regular playing time in the chicago outfield though he hasnt taken advantage hitting 189 with 2 hr and 1 sb over 74 ab in september for a player expected to provide some speed hes struck out a ridiculous 355 for the month and that cripples his value theres a good chance the white sox look towards another option over the final week of the season and engel is easily ignored
yolmer sanchez third baseman
hes finishing strong hitting 275 with 3 hr and 3 sb over 69 ab in september theres nothing awful about his strikeout rate 234 though hes posted a 500 fly ball rate for the month hes not a tremendous power option so its a bit of a scary number and makes it unlikely that he can maintain his current 327 babip this month obviously anything can happen over the course of a week so if you need to ride him go for it especially since he sees a lot of time hitting atop the order however its a trend to keep an eye on as we head into 18

damien what have you made of the response in myanmar hannah especially from the countrys leader and nobel peace prize winner daw aung san suu kyi
hannah its complicated i think that when she became the de facto leader of the myanmar government last year there was this wish from the international community that we would have this feelgood narrative
in asia its been a story of the rollback of democracy and so here was just one story where there was this peaceful transition from a military junta that ruled for almost 50 years to a civilian leader this democracy activist this nobel peace prize laureate

and the truth of the matter is that she is still very very constrained and the military controls a lot of things and controls the people who are committing what seem to be atrocities in the rohingya areas in northern rakhine state and in western myanmar
having said that she is the nobel peace prize laureate and the one weapon that she has that the military doesnt have is her moral authority and she has not used it and so i think that the international community has every right to call her and say look you know we understand that your position is very difficult but if you dont speak out for these people then who will

youre a relatively newly installed bureau chief for the times in southeast asia though youve been covering the region for years what else are you looking at in the region
the thing about southeast asia is its 11 countries or so all of which are very different and nothing really ties them together except i would say maybe two things
one is the fact that democracy has been seriously challenged throughout the region you look at thailand where i am now which is now ruled by a military junta you have myanmar which has this kind of quasicivilian government you look at malayasia where there are allegations of corruption and a rollback of rights and the philippines where you have a leader who has publicly endorsed a fatal drug war you have indonesia which is kind of the shining light of democracy in the region but has serious ethnic and religious issues of its own
the other issue is a religious change and it relates to myanmar as well there you have this divide between a buddhist majority nation and a muslim minority in thailand you have the similar thing you have a country that is about 90 percent buddhist with in the south a muslim insurgency
and then you have places like malaysia and indonesia where its majority muslim but there are significant religious minorities chafing against the majority so you have these kind of religious fault lines throughout the region that i think are something were really paying attention to"
"__label__real cnn on monday night sources close to donald trump promised that he hadnt finished his feud with tennessee sen bob corker they werent kidding
the failing nytimes set liddle bob corker up by recording his conversation trump tweeted tuesday morning was made to sound a fool and thats what i am dealing with
corker is relatively short in stature hes 57 while trump is right around 63 corkers height was according to the daily caller one of the big reasons the tennessee republican didnt make the cut to be trumps secretary of state
two sources with knowledge of the transition say that the tennessee senators short stature was a key factor the daily caller report said yes really
the focus on corkers height is the latest example of the fact that the president of the united states namecalls like your average fifthgrade bully as he demonstrated throughout the 2016 campaign this is trumps default approach to politics and life he has a unique gift to zero in on peoples weaknesses and then pick at them relentlessly
lyin ted lil marco low energy jeb crooked hillary little rocket man pocahontas
it worked like a charm in the campaign trumps voters loved his lack of political correctness they loved that he called politicians out they loved that he refused to apologize for anything
but the lowest and darkest moment came in south carolina in november 2015 when trump mocked new york times reporter serge kovaleski after he pointed out the candidates assertions about thousands of people celebrating the 911 attacks in the new york area were false
now the poor guy you ought to see this guy ah i dont know what i said i dont remember i dont remember maybe thats what i said trump said wildly flailing his arms that gesturing was widely interpreted as trump mocking kovaleski who has arthrogryposis a congenital condition that creates arm movements very similar to those trump used to describe the reporter trump denied he was mocking kovaleski you be the judge 
trumps voters seemed to overlook or condone his bullying under the theory that a he wasnt really serious b his status as a change agent mattered more than his personal character or c they kindof liked it because they hated the people he was bullying
there was also some sense among his supporters and even those who didnt vote for him and couldnt even imagine him becoming president that once the gravity of the office hit him he might change there was some thinking occasionally stoked by trump himself that he was only acting like this because it was how he had to win the campaign once he was elected president everything would change
i will be so presidential you will be so bored trump promised in april 2016 youll say cant he have a little more energy
trump didnt change if anything he has become more of a namecalling bully than he was in the campaign side bar how many 71yearold men fundamentally change their personality if you answered none you got it right
he got in a fight with the australian prime minister
he shoved aside literally the prime minister of montenegro
hes taunted north korean dictator kim jong un
hes savaged msnbcs mika brzezinksi for bleeding badly from a facelift
hes said the media dont like our country
i could go on and on but you get the idea bullies bully name callers call names its what they do
there are two impacts of the fact that the president is a bully you can like him or hate him but its hard to see how you can conclude that he isnt one at this point
the first is that trumps almostobsessive need to always respond any time he feels as though he has been attacked or his character has been questioned makes for a terrible legislative strategy
including his ongoing fight with corker trump has insulted or personally impugned well more than a dozen republican senators thats stunning given that republicans only have a twoseat majority in the senate and as the health care fight showed have almost no margin for error on anything but the most benign pieces of legislation
trump is cutting off his nose to spite his face with these attacks on tax reform iran immigration and north korea and any other issue you can name there is no path to success for trump that doesnt include corker and lots of the other senators he has attacked
the second and more important point here is that trump whether he likes it or not is a role model people look to our leaders for guidelines as to how they should act when the president acts like a bully even with people he needs to work with he gives significant license for others to follow his lead he normalizes this sort of behavior he makes it ok for people to treat one another the way he seems to treat well everyone
thats a very bad thing whether you are a democrat a republican or dont care about politics at all"

the italian utility was weighing whether to bid for some regional distribution firms that are up for sale said carlo zorzoli enels senior country officer in brazil
of course we are going to look at these concessions because they are growth opportunities and we are in a stage where we are weighing all opportunities to expand he said in an interview late on friday
statecontrolled centrais elétricas brasileiras sa known as eletrobras wants to sell six of its power distribution companies later this year or early next year for what sources have said will be a token amount
we are active in the market choosing the opportunities that best fit our strategy zorzoli said
brazils power sector is going through a process of consolidation with many local players putting assets up for sale to cut debt at a time of tight credit
enel spent 149 billion reais 473 million last week for a license to operate the volta grande hydroelectric dam a 380megawatt plant located in minas gerais state
it was the second large acquisition in the sector in two years for enel which in recent years has focused on fastgrowing latin american investments to counterbalance sluggish european markets
last year it won the privatization auction for celgd a power distribution firm in brazils centerwest state of goiás
power distribution is one sector going through consolidation the number of operators currently is too large said zorzoli adding that the eletrobras auction looked to be attractive for investors
brazils government has tried to attract foreign capital to help boost the economy after the countrys worst recession on record
enel was also considering bidding for wind and solar power project licenses in brazil this year zorzoli said without elaborating
a controlling stake in rio de janeiro power utility light sa that is up for sale by centrais elétricas de minas gerais sa cemig may also be of interest he said
we are looking at all opportunities it depends on the conditions he said on the one hand it could offer synergies on the other it could overload us with problems

i truly do
and its because of that love that im going to ask a favor of you whether you are entrenched in a patellarbased quarrel or just pissed about last weeks performance im gonna need you to get your collective heads out of your collective asses
steelers week is upon us
if even for just one weekend i dont want to hear the drama just lock it up tweetdelete it or save the facebook post in your draft for the postgame
instead i want you to wear your purple with pride hit the streets on this beautiful purple friday and let the random steelers fans in town know that we dont cower in the face of controversy that we come together as a family and we cannot be divided by anything especially on this week when we plan to trounce pittsburgh
let all of those feels resurface baltimore
of course those pesky steelers fans wont just go away trust me ive tried no theyll surely spit crap back at ya i want to say figuratively not literally but ya never know with them
and with that lets go ahead and start the weekend of mockery with what can only be deemed the top 5 yinzerisms the most ear piercing nails on the chalkboard idiotic things that tend to dribble out of the jackolanternesque smirks of every steelers fans anytime you try to drop a knowledge bomb on them
shall we
oh and side note please fell free to turn this into a drinking game come sunday because if it goes anything like last sunday youll need a few dozen
5flaccos a bum
response so lets look at this objectively joe flacco has faced pittsburgh 20 times in his career with a 1010 record 98 regular season 12 playoffs against the steelers with wins in his last three games in baltimore against mike tomlin friends looking at the first headtohead matchup in every season since flacco came into the nfl in 2008 joe has beat pittsburgh seven of a possible nine times sure youll point to the playoffs to which ill simply say flacco has only faced the steelers three times in the playoffs winning his most recent game 3017 in 2014 a few years earlier he won a super bowl along with a super bowl mvp
say now does ben have one of those mvp things huh guess its not for everyone

response let me stop you there heres how this will go youll say ray lewis atlanta white suit then ill say big ben bathroom stall multiple allegations then youll say terrell suggs bleach and ex to which ill reply james harrison door cell phone snap
up next would likely be ray rice which ill agree was several shades of wrong but then ill raise you a joey porter hines ward throw a jeff reed for shiggles well continue to do this dance until were talking about future prospects they may take and how awful that would be
lets just not lets be civilized and talk about how _____
3 any use of the word yinz
response can we talk about yinz please do you even know where it comes from and please dont just say it comes from pittsburgh its actually of irishscottish heritage as an abbreviated second person plural pronoun for yous ones because we all know how often talking to friends were likely to say hey yous ones as opposed to hey guys or fellas nope yinz make much more sense which is why i suppose yinzers are how yous ones identify yourselves in pittsburgh i tried googling that heres what i got
could be worse i suppose urban dictionary is a little less subtle suggesting a yinzer is white trash from western pennsylvania and extremely dumb toothless losers that can be found in large masses watching steeler games their most prized possessions are their terrible towels which they would permanently trade in a moments notice for running water and soap
maybe not the image yinz looking for
2 inaudible yammering terrible towel
response neat so ya have yourself a towel there huh sport what kinda things do you use that towel for anyways do you take it to the gym oh the closest thing to a workout you do is pull the recline lever on the layzboy well what about like maybe any other typical towel uses like drying your hands or a car no
so you just sort of swing it around your head but only when positive plays happen like touchdowns wait you just do it arbitrarily throughout games even when youre bleeding the lizard as you call it in the bathroom at the stadium so you bring a towel in then wash your hands but dont use the towel to dry them
wait why do they call it a terrible towel anyway thats kinda awful marketing right
oh but theres history thats neat googles terrible towel wait you do know the towel was literally made as a gimmick to get listeners to tune in to a radio station right and that theyre made in green bay
no okay see your response shouldnt just be waving the towel over your head
1 count the rangs
response we get it pal you have more rings than fingers on one hand we also get that the steelers have been around since 1933 whereas the ravens have been around since 1996 no no no dont you hurt that precious noggin of yours trying to do math ill get this one for you thats 63 years difference
and honestly if youd like i can do a little more math for ya the ravens have 2 super bowls in 21 seasons so baltimore wins a championship roughly once a decade thats 10 years
the steelers have 6 in 84 years meaning they win a super bowl roughly once in every 14 years a
nd wouldnt ya know it 14 is bigger than 10 the ravens have less rings in less years but win those rings at a higher rate
huh neat

"__label__real london reuters the oil market is rebalancing fast and has almost entirely erased the glut of refined products as opec sticks to its supply pact opecs secretary general said on monday
opecs mohammad barkindo also said growth in us shale oil output had slowed compared to the first half of 2017 and growth in global demand may show further upward revisions giving the supply cut effort tailwind
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and other nonmember producers are cutting output by about 18 million barrels per day bpd until next march to get rid of a pricesapping supply glut
the aim of the opecled cut is to trim the level of oil in oecd industrialized countries to the fiveyear average opec and its allies agreed the deal last year after prices collapsed due to oversupply hurting the income of producing countries
there is clear evidence that the market is rebalancing barkindo said in a recorded speech provided for the reuters global commodities summit taking place this week
the process of global destocking continues both onshore and offshore with positive developments in recent months showing not only a quickening of the process but a massive drainage of oil tanks across all regions
oil lcoc1 prices have gained support and in late september reached almost 60 a barrel the highest in more than two years but brent crude trading at 55 on monday is still half its level of mid2014
opec has said that oecd oil stocks as of august had fallen to 170 million barrels above the fiveyear average down from 340 million barrels in january
barkindo said in the speech that 145 million barrels of the remaining 170 millionbarrel surplus was crude but inventories of refined products were approaching the desired level
just a mere 25 million barrels are products almost converging with the five year average he said
brent backwardation helps
barkindo said oil volumes in floating storage were also falling and brents move into backwardation a market structure in which oil for prompt delivery costs more than future supply made storing crude uneconomic
crude in floating storage is down by an estimated 40 million barrels since the start of the year with help of a narrowing contango since june and then brent flipping into a clear backwardation from the second week of september he said
this trend will obviously make it unprofitable to continue to store crude
oil demand has surprised forecasters to the upside opec in its last monthly report raised its projections for oil consumption this year and next and this development could have further to run
these upward demand revisions are most likely to be an ongoing trend barkindo said
opec is also seeing a decline in growth in us shale oil output whose increasing volumes helped bring about the slide in prices three years ago
we have recently seen a deceleration in us tight oil growth compared to the first half of the year evidenced recently by falling productivity of wells particularly in the permian basin as well as growing concerns from the investment community barkindo said
opec and its allies are considering extending the supply cutting deal beyond its march expiry they hold their next policysetting meeting on nov 30 in vienna

the ashes arguably international crickets most vicious rivalry rolls around once more in november although england emerged victorious 31 in the australian series of 201011 the series of 201314 saw australia enact vengeance in the most emphatic way possible a 50 whitewash given the squads home ashes record australia would always be favourites against england however the home side have never been so widely backed to score a second consecutive home whitewash over england
50 whitewash universally expected
to say that the two sides approach the series in contrasting mindsets would be an understatement and this is reflected in current ashes odds which can be viewed by anyone who opts to click here after losing 21 to south africa last autumn australia have bounced back in very real terms with perfect home test form prevalent after that disappointing showing against the springboks by contrast england will travel to australia in unusually low spirits with ben stokes recent exclusion on disciplinary grounds from the visiting squad only serving to divide and disrupt
englands away form can only give the australian squad even more encouragement with the squad losing 41 to india in its last away test series some experts would assert that englands only true hope is joe root with most of the other expected first xi performing erratically of late to the more ardent england fan alastair cook is considered something of a talisman but many believe that age is now catching up with him even at home england have been susceptible to the occasional batting collapse with the fourth test in the recent home series against the west indies being a very damning case in hand
smith can be captain fantastic
as one of the chosen few to be an ashes captain steve smith will naturally be in the spotlight more than any other home player though his captaincy has seen mixed fortunes for australia if all forms of international cricket are taken into account his personal statistics spell danger for england as of june 2017 smith had scored twelve centuries and averaged 7327 per inning overcoming a humiliation at the hands of south africa in 2016 was also a real test of character for smith with his captaincy then very much in the balance 2017 has been a truer reflection of his abilities and smith also has a test win rate of exactly 50 as australias captain
nsw trio to give england the blues
much of the confidence in the home side stems from the range of efficient fast bowlers that australia coach darren lehmann has at his disposal
pat cummins josh hazlewood and mitchell starc are the most prominent men in that respect with the latter two being lefthanded australia will have the luxury of a multidimensional approach to dismissing englands top batsmen the fact that the trio are teammates at the nsw blues can only add further fuel to the arguments in favour of an australian whitewash
david warner 30 not out
though now the wrong side of thirty top order batsman david warner has the experience and composure needed to fulfil the expectation of a whitewash though part of a side that completed a 41 odi series defeat to india just days ago it was warners neversaydie attitude which yielded the century that enabled the touring aussies to win and avoid a whitewash as one of the most hardhitting australian batsmen in recent memory those who simply crave entertainment will certainly be keeping one eye on warner
looking ahead
lehmanns uncompromising australia squad has the impetus but stranger things have happened in international cricket the 201718 ashes series begins at the gabba on 23 november

sometimes after a loss to anyone there can be tendency to ask whats wrong why did we lose etc etc virginia tech lost saturday night to clemson 3117 but hokie fans should still very encouraged by their program direction
lets be honest clemson is just at another level from the rest of college football save alabama right now im saying it right now this clemson team is better than last years national championship team last season was more about incredible individual talents like mike williams and deshaun watson this season clemson is a more complete team with a defense that is simply frightening this hokie team isnt really competing with clemson at the moment but i believe they will be down the road
weve seen the virginia tech program win 10 games in its first year under justin fuente dc bud fosters record speaks for itself they started this year beating a good west virginia team and dominanting the rest of their schedule until saturday night coaching wise virginia tech is near or at the level of clemson
player for player though clemson is a measuring stick for where virginia tech is trying to get its a very simple matter for the hokies recruit recruit and recruit some more josh jackson is a young talented qb that virginia tech can build around in year 2 it was probably asking too much for virginia tech to beat a team of clemsons caliber give it a couple of more years under fuente the hokies are on the rise and right on schedule

the european union has launched a fresh crackdown over taxes paid by tech giants amazon and apple
amazon has been ordered to repay 250m 221m 293m in back taxes after the european commission said it had been given an unfair tax deal in luxembourg
the commission also plans to take ireland to court over its failure to collect 13bn of back taxes from apple
amazon denied it owed any back tax saying it did not receive any special treatment from luxembourg
we will study the commissions ruling and consider our legal options including an appeal an amazon spokesperson said
but european competition commissioner margrethe vestager said the luxembourg arrangement meant that amazon had been allowed to pay substantially less tax than other businesses which it said was illegal under eu state aid rules
facebooks uk tax bill rises to 51m
why amazons uk tax bill has dropped 50
apple fights back over eu tax ruling
selective benefits
luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to amazon as a result almost threequarters of amazons profits were not taxed ms vestager added
she said amazon paid four times less tax than other local companies
member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others she added
image copyright getty images image caption the commission said until the taxes were recovered apple was still continuing to benefit from an illegal advantage
meanwhile the commission said it planned to refer ireland to the european court of justice for failing to recover 13bn in back taxes from tech giant apple
it concluded last year that the us firms irish tax benefits were illegal enabling the firm to pay a corporate tax rate of no more than 1
the commission said that more than a year on from that decision ireland had still not recovered the money
as a result it was referring ireland to the european court of justice it said
ireland which has contested the decision claiming that eu regulators were interfering with national sovereignty said the decision was extremely disappointing
todays decisions are to order luxembourg to recover unpaid tax from amazon and refer ireland to the european court for failing to recover unpaid tax from apple i hope that both decisions are seen as a message that companies must pay their fair share of taxes as the huge majority of companies do said ms vestager
amazon investigation
the decision on amazon follows a threeyear long investigation by the european commission which said in 2014 that it had suspicions the arrangement had broken eu rules
the tax deal between luxembourg and amazon was struck in 2003
the commission said it had enabled amazon to shift the vast majority of its profits from amazon eu to amazon europe holding technologies which was not subject to tax

"__label__real us ambassador to turkey john bass speaks during a meeting with media members in ankara tukey october 11 2017 reutersstringer
ankara reuters the united states is still seeking an explanation from ankara for the detention of staff at us missions in turkey which led washington to stop issuing visas and triggered a diplomatic crisis the us ambassador said on wednesday
ambassador john bass said the decision to suspend granting visas was not taken lightly but the detentions indicated a breakdown in communication between the two nato allies whose relations have come under increasing strain
unfortunately the us government still has not received any official communications from the turkish government about the reasons why our local employees have been detained or arrested he told reporters at the us embassy in ankara
washington says two locally employed staff were arrested in turkey this year in may a translator at the consulate in the southern province of adana was arrested and last week a drug enforcement administration worker was detained in istanbul
president tayyip erdogans spokesman said last week the istanbul employee metin topuz had been in contact with a leading suspect in last years failed military coup turkish media reported similar accusations against the translator
the notion that people in our employment are facing or are under suspicion of terrorism charges here that is a very serious allegation bass said it is one we want to take seriously and we want to better understand the ostensible evidence that supports these allegations
since the failed military coup in july last year in which at least 240 people were killed more than 50000 people have been detained and 150000 including teachers academics soldiers and journalists have been suspended from work
some western allies fear the crackdown shows the country is slipping ever deeper into authoritarian rule under erdogan
ankara says its critics fail to understand the scale of the security challenges in turkey which has also faced conflict on its southern borders with iraq and syria and an insurgency in its mainly kurdish southeast
us consulate is pictured in istanbul turkey october 11 2017 reutersmurad sezer
envoy targeted
erdogan has blamed bass for the latest dispute suggesting he acted unilaterally in suspending visa services and declaring that his government no longer considered bass to be washingtons envoy and would not hold meetings with him
the us state department denied bass acted alone saying his actions were coordinated with officials in washington
in a sign that ankara was stepping back from the pledge to exclude bass turkish television channels reported that he met a foreign ministry official later on wednesday the ambassador is due to leave turkey within days to take up a post in afghanistan
usturkish tensions have risen in recent months over us military support for kurdish ypg fighters in syria considered by ankara to be an extension of the banned pkk which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast turkey
turkey has also pressed so far in vain for the united states to extradite muslim cleric fethullah gulen a former ally of erdogan who is viewed in ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup
another source of friction was the us indictment of turkeys former economy minister zafer caglayan for conspiring to violate us sanctions on iran a us court also indicted 15 of erdogans guards after they clashed with protesters during his visit to washington in may
in addition to the two detained consulate workers turkey is holding a us pastor on charges which turkish media say include membership of gulens network bass called for the release of the christian missionary andrew brunson saying he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against him
he denied reports that turkish police were trying to speak to another consulate employee to the best of our knowledge there are not any outstanding requests from turkish law enforcement officials for any of our local staff to come in and talk to them he said"

"__label__fake can ravens bounce back vs rivals
before its news
perception is reality
reality the baltimore ravens continue to deal with crushing injuries
football is won in trenches losses of williams yanda are evident ravens overall look sluggish injuries continue give jags credit too sarah ellison sgellison september 24 2017
perception brandon williams did not make the trip to london and he was missed corey grant and leonard fournette ran through holes that williams might have clogged the ravens paid williams this offseason because he is one of the best and they needed him to anchor the d and how we see what could happen with him not there but how long will he not be there the only thing we have heard from coach john harbaugh is that it is not a longterm injury but we heard the same about breshad perrimans his rookie year and we saw how that turned out hopefully john learned his lesson on that one
with games against the steelers and raiders on the horizon williams will be needed
not having marshal yanda was killer on sunday too joe flacco did not have the protection that he needed and it showed
brent urban got injured sunday and will miss the rest of the season that puts 17 players on injured reserve two more players on ir than anyone else in the league according to espn our own brian mcfarland reports that the ravens have 81 players on their salary cap 53man roster 16 on ir 10 on practice squad and that is five more than the next closest team its also more than they had all of last year and its only week 3
the question may not be how good can the ravens be but will they be able to field a team for a whole season
reality flacco threw another interception two actually and now has thrown one in nine straight games
this morning against the jaguars joe flacco finished with 1 yards in the air meaning 29 of his 28 total yards came after the catch lorin cox coxsports1 september 25 2017
perception i have been a big supporter of joe flacco when you look around the league flacco stacks up as a top 10 qb when you look at the success he has had over his career you could say that he is a very good quarterback in 141 games flacco is 8556 has thrown for over 33000 yards has 185 touchdowns but has 121 interceptions the playoffs are where he has earned his money going 105 with 25 tds and 10 ints and most importantly a super bowl win and a super bowl mvp award
there are not many qbs in the league that have that kind of resume but that is in the past we need to look at now and the future and right now flacco stinks since flacco led the ravens to a championship in 2012 he has thrown 70 td and has 61 ints that is not good
it doesnt get much worse for a quarterback then what flacco did on sunday morning 8for18 for just 28 yards no touchdowns and two ints and as lorin cox said those 28 yards were all receivers flacco had 1 yards in the air that is just awful so awful that you cant even comprehend that a starting nfl qb did that
flacco admitted after the week 2 win against the browns that he is not fully healthy flacco has been struggling with injuries over the last few seasons and missed all of training camp and preseason due to back issues but he wouldnt even want to use that as an excuse those things happen and if you are on the field then you are responsible for your play if you are hurt then sit and let someone else do it
should the ravens let someone else lead this team while he rests his back i guess well find out by how he plays sunday
reality its steelers week in baltimore
steelers week enough said ravensflock pictwittercom3lhgqidkta patrick gleason pmgleason september 26 2017
perception the ravens were not going undefeated so it really doesnt matter if they lost by 37 or 1 its just one game during a week that saw a lot of things we didnt predict steelers losing to the bears broncos losing to bills jets beating the dolphins raiders losing to washington
teams will have a bad day and its time to shake it off and beat up on someone else this week and that team happens to be our archrival
pittsburgh leads the alltime series 2521 but baltimore has won four of the last five meetings the steelers are listed as 25point favorites for this game in charm city after both teams lost last week
the ravens dont get blown out often but when john harbaughs team does they usually bounce back as they are 72 in games following losses by 20 or more points according to espn and if you need a little encouragement the ravens lost in houston by 30 points in october 2012 but came back and won the super bowl a few months later
pittsburgh comes into baltimore struggling on offense ranking 21st in the league in yards while the ravens are 30th defensively the ravens were great the first two weeks of the season but after laying an egg last week they rank 20th in the league while the steelers d is 3rd in yards allowed
the ravens need to go back to what they did in week 1 and week 2 with a concentration on running the ball effectively can they do that without yanda and against a strong steeler defense if not baltimore will have to rely on flacco to throw it downfield and that hasnt worked out so well this year
but the records stats and past performances all get thrown out this week its time to beat someone up and the toughest most aggressive team will win this game lets hope its baltimore 2317

by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
keep in mind that at this point in the season any pitcher can be scratched at any time for any reason when looking for a streaming option you have to be careful and monitor the news and situations closely but with that thought in mind lets take a look at a few streaming options over the final two days of the season
saturday september 30
jake junis kansas city royals vs arizona
cbs sports 48 espn 189
if you look at junis overall 439 era and 129 whip you arent going to be very impressed though he has a split that needs to catch your attention
home 349 era
road 503 era
arizonas offense also isnt impressive on the road with a 395 slg 23rd in the league and 233 avg 28th in the league while hes not guaranteed a win things seem to lean in junis favor for a strong outing to finish up the season
sunday october 1
daniel mengden oakland as at texas
cbs sports 25 espn 388
mengden wasnt as impressive as he has been in his last outing but he still owns a 193 era in four september starts and will take on a texas offense that is hitting 231 in september he is tentatively scheduled to face off with cole hamels but theres talk that hamels wont take the mound and that will further strengthen mengdens case likely giving him a better shot at a win
anibal sanchez detroit tigers at minnesota
cbs sports 13 espn 44
over his past three starts sanchez has allowed 4 er over 180 ip with 25 k vs 5 bb in the process the twins will have nothing to play for instead likely resting their regulars as they prepare for their wild card matchup with the way hes pitching and that in mind sanchez has a good chance to finish his season on a high note

"__label__real now the authorities are planning tougher measures last month chinas legislature approved a law prohibiting disrespect of the anthem barring the songs use in commercials or parodies and outlining punishments for people who do not stand with respect and maintain a dignified bearing when it is played
weekslong street protests in hong kong known as the umbrella movement ended three years ago without the government ceding any ground on expanding residents say in local elections
but that spirit of protest has been revived in the stadium jeers which appear to have started two years ago hong kong played china in world cup qualifiers twice in 2015 and those matches took on an added political dimension coming a year after the street protests
photo
with a population of seven million hong kong is a minnow in the ocean of international soccer but the city has a long history with the sport and with the help of some foreignborn players often punches above its weight
china has a huge population to draw from and its teams have been successful in several sports but its mens soccer teams have routinely struggled in international competition
in 1985 hong kong beat china 21 in beijing to eliminate the team from qualifying for the following years world cup setting off a riot in the 2015 world cup qualifiers hong kong tied china twice to add to the insult the home fans booed the chinese national anthem before the game in hong kong
the world governing body for soccer fifa fined the hong kong football association for fans booing during one of the china matches and also during a 2015 world cup qualifier against qatar the citys football association has called on fans to behave and stewards make vain attempts to encourage hardcore supporters to keep quiet during the national anthem

the anthem march of the volunteers was a poem set to music in 1935 and it became popular as a call for resistance against japan its lyricist tian han died in prison during the cultural revolution in 1968
the anthem law went into effect on oct 1 but hong kong a former british colony maintains a semiautonomous existence that allows it to keep its own economic and legal systems so hong kong will need to enact its own version of the law which it has yet to do

thus far hong kong fans are unbowed
we do it spontaneously because we dont think we are part of the prc said sanho chung 24 who was at tuesdays game using an abbreviation for the peoples republic of china we are different
rights activists and prodemocracy politicians are concerned that the law could be used to suppress free expression
i think it will be quite problematic to apply it said dennis kwok a member of hong kongs legislative council
photo
he noted that the mainland law allows the police to place violators in administrative detention for 15 days that method of incarceration which bypasses the courts does not exist in hong kong
and the idea of showing reverence will be hard to define he said what does it mean to be respectful of the national anthem mr kwok said that concept of law is simply unheardof here to have to stand in silence i think we need to be very careful defining what is respectful and what is not
hong kong officials say the national anthem law is a routine matter that should not prompt concern among residents
i just want to reiterate that rightly so we are living in a more politicized environment but we need not adopt this very politicized stance in considering and dealing with any matter carrie lam the chief executive of hong kong said in august this particular matter of national anthem legislation does not carry any particular scope for politicization
advertisement continue reading the main story
in recent months the authorities have taken several steps to punish people for protesting or for calling for hong kongs independence now even symbolic protests are being suppressed
last month a lawmaker was fined 5000 hong kong dollars about 640 for turning upside down several small hong kong and chinese flags on desks in the legislative council chamber
and the appearance of posters calling for hong kong independence on a wall run by the student union at the chinese university of hong kong set off debate between local and mainland students school administrators and hong kong officials called the signs illegal but legal scholars said it was questionable whether colonialera sedition laws could be enforced
the introduction of a national anthem law is coming at a time when people who oppose symbols of the chinese government and symbols of the chinese communist party have reason to fear they could end up behind bars said maya wang senior china researcher for human rights watch this could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression
on tuesday at the match against malaysia mr chung clad in a red home jersey stood with fellow fans during halftime he said the national anthem law would not stop him from booing
it does dampen our freedom of speech forcing us to respect something he said i worry but i will still practice my rights i think this is my right"

"__label__fake by josef dobraszczyk words camila calderoni images
the state of chiapas hosts some of the most spectacular scenery in perhaps all of mexico from dense tropical jungles to sweeping green mountain canyons it is also officially the poorest state with one of the highest percentage of indigenous populations often reliant on smallscale subsistence farming for survival within this incredibly diverse state the zapatista army of national liberation ezln has existed for over 24 years primarily an indigenous lands rights struggle zapatismo has sought to offer a radically different model of decentralized governance ideologically placing itself as a living alternative to neoliberal capitalism within a global struggle
this movement came to international prominence on january 1st 1994 with a statewide insurrection timed to coincide exactly with the implementation of the north american free trade agreement nafta between the us mexico and canada amongst many other conditions pressured by the us government of the time nafta put an end to communal land rights held within the mexican constitution since the 1917 revolution affecting up to 25 million peasant farmers losing any faith in official cooperation after years of government affronts to indigenous communities the zapatistas looked instead to uprising and autonomous organization as their only remaining option many thousands in chiapas took hope and inspiration from this action with hundreds of villages choosing to declare themselves autonomous free from government rule but organized under the networked umbrella of zapatismo
although predominantly based in such rural and indigenous communities zapatismo finds its greatest urban support base in the city of san cristobal a colourful and artistic city well visited on the backpackertourist trail zapatista imagery can be found in countless bars cafes and shops across the centre yet the movement keep many of their activities relatively private for numerous reasons including the fact that they are technically in open conflict with the mexican government so its a rare occasion that they offer a very public event as we find in the case of the second annual comparte festival taking place within san cristobal
at any given time during the festival you could find slapstick tightrope clowning on topics of migration naked theatre around gender constructs or a zapatista norteño band playing on one of many different stages across the site naturally every aspect of the festival is free to attend the spirit being that all are invited to participate to share and collaborate in each others art against capital and its walls all of the arts being the tagline promoted by the festival there are childrens art workshops giant mural paintings and collective jarana strumming circles with many of those presenting workshops and art from various latin american countries and europe
the first five days of events are held at cideci or university of the earth an independent university that normally hosts regular zapatista conferences and the annual meeting of the national indigenous congress cni an organization officially separate but inextricably linked to the zapatista movement at their yearly council this may they elected nahua indigenous healer and mother of three maría de jesús patricio martínez as their electoral presidential candidate for the upcoming 2018 elections they are keen to state this not a genuine attempt to gain electoral power rather an opportunity to challenge the electoral model itself instead proposing a horizontal structure of organizing between communities we do not seek to administer power we want to dismantle it from within we want to build a new structure from below many see this as an opportunity for the zapatistas and national indigenous congress to nationally challenge the government that they see as the main source of oppression towards indigenous groups in chiapas and indeed the wider working population of mexico
aside from indigenous rights struggles there is certainly no shortage of human rights violations and current causes being advocated by the social justice movement in mexico during the festival many images and slogans remember the 1997 massacre in acteal a zapatista village in which 45 were killed including a number of pregnant women and their unborn children although officially attributed to a neighbouring village most in chiapas believe this to have been an act orchestrated by the ruling institutional revolutionary party pri government of the time of which all the leading figures have avoided trial after formal submissions to the high court another painfully ongoing campaign in mexico is the 43 disappeared students of ayotzinapa declared missing after a student protest in 2014 with major differences between formal and external investigations about the role of official security services in the deaths many see this event as emblematic of the wider corruption in mexico in which many believe the government unofficially legitimise and support the narcotrafficking drug barons perpetuating violence and fear across the country
one of the rallying moments of the festival comes when the comparsa marching band begin their procession complete with multiple percussionists a full brass section various accordions and a spectacular dance troupe they incite a riotous brigade of dancing and singing across the site distributing pamphlets printed with their politically charged lyrics for all to join the chanting it seems to sum up the festivals spirit of colourful defiance in the face of a tragic history and very present threat where journalists are regularly murdered and activists imprisoned for public protest
the final two days of the festival take place in oventic a zapatista village in the mountains near san cristobal declared autonomous in 1994 as one of the five major caracols that make up the zapatista regional structure in chiapas the atmosphere is markedly different here presenting theatre and music produced predominantly by those from indigenous and rural zapatista communities
one masked zapatista volunteer is keen to stress the international nature of the festival and the movement stating we are all zapatistas wherever you are in whatever country you live we are fighting for madre tierra against those who would seek to exploit it for their own profit its this sort of language that has often captured the attention of international anticapitalist movements who see the zapatista movement as a living example of the slogan another world is possible that came to major prominence in 2001 around the seattle antiglobalisation protests
its this same internationalism however that forms the basis for criticisms of the zapatista movement some claim that it is now more of a media image than a movement addressing the reality of challenges faced by villages in chiapas a state that has become equally famous for zapatourism in which tourists can buy handcraft zapatista souvenirs to support the struggle for the week
when speaking to those living in some of the more remote zapatista villages the daily life of the struggle is indeed a far cry from the vibrant week of art experienced by those visiting for the duration of the festival in may of 2017 the village of cruzton came under attack suffering an onslaught of bullets that lasted for hours in which one member of the community was killed as with acteal the community believe that the government initiated the attacks as a response to their nonviolent declaration of autonomy one member of the community states they attack us because they know the zapatista movement is a new dawn that 1994 was the people waking up the attack received almost zero coverage outside of zapatista channels
yet there is a keen remembrance of this repression across chiapas and twenty four years after their initial declaration of autonomy there still seems to be a widespread belief in the prospects of zapatismo for a better way of life in order to live by their ideals the zapatista communities have sacrificed many financial benefits that have been increasingly offered by the government in recent years a form of bribery and cooptation as many in the communities see it
undoubtedly the zapatista movement is an international symbol which manages to draw in an impressive variety of visitors and artists for the comparte festival its a testament to how the actions of one group in one particular region can have such a farreaching global impact serving to inspire artists thinkers and social movements internationally this idea of international publicity seems to serve a double purpose for the zapatistas however acting as a kind of defence mechanism in keeping up the awareness of rural communities that are at daily risk of attack communities that are still seeking to live autonomously function with independent school systems workers cooperatives and communal land cultivation the organizational systems aim to decentralize power at every opportunity and there seems to be a deeply held belief in the community to work collectively as keepers of the land rooted in a shared history of maize cultivation stretching back countless generations seemingly simple beliefs firmly rooted in ancestral tradition they seem to offer a radical and dangerous opposition to the idea of a global trade system reliant on unlimited access to land and labour seemingly simple beliefs worth sharing through the art music and theatre that seeks to reach out internationally to those seeking the possibility of another world for all constructed together and from below"
"__label__real file photo workers board up a broken window at the mandalay bay hotel where shooter stephen paddock conducted his mass shooting along the las vegas strip in las vegas nevada us october 6 2017 reuterschris wattiefile photo
las vegas reuters what will become of the nownotorious las vegas hotel suite that a 64yearold retiree used to stage the deadliest mass shooting in modern us history
that is the difficult decision facing the mandalay bay resort and casino a week after stephen paddock opened fire on a crowd at an outdoor concert from room 135 on the hotels 32nd floor killing 58 and injuring more than 500
the suites shattered goldtinted windows are now discreetly covered over the resort owned by mgm resorts international mgmn has yet to say what it will do with the space
the challenge is particularly difficult for a hotel in las vegas a place where visitors go to escape everyday lives and realworld problems
how do they navigate the fact that this happened in their hotel said andrea trapani managing partner at identity a detroitarea public relations firm that provides crisis communications for hospitality brands a lot of challenging tough questions and decisions are going to be made
the hotel might want to consider sealing up room 32135 or even the entire floor to avoid becoming a destination site for gawkers fascinated by its macabre history some experts have suggested
officials facing similar decisions at the schools churches and other places where mass shootings have taken place in recent years have gone in a variety of directions
some of the venues have been dismantled completely others like the san bernardino california community center where a husband and wife killed 14 people in december 2015 have reopened with officials saying that getting back to work helping people was integral to healing
the orlando florida nightclub where a gunman killed 49 people in june 2016 remains closed and the owner plans to turn it into a memorial
connecticuts sandy hook elementary school where 20 children and six adults were killed in 2012 was demolished and rebuilt four years later
a spokesman for mandalay bay declined to comment on its plans
but it appeared highly unlikely the suite would simply reopen as if nothing had happened there on oct 1
i wouldnt want to stay in that room said north carolina tourist randy dockery at a makeshift memorial for the victims in a narrow patch of grass along the las vegas strip
some experts suggested mandalay bay should erect a memorial somewhere in the hotel either permanent or temporary and throw a fundraiser for the victims and their families
the hotel was absolutely a victim as well and by transforming some space into something that honors the victims they could hopefully promote healing and actually some good said kim miller president of floridabased ink link marketing whose work includes advising companies on crisis management
for dockery the choice was obvious
the memorial should be over there he said pointing at the hotel but probably they dont want the publicity"
"__label__fake joseph levy a research associate at the university of texas institute for geophysics and his team have recently made some incredible discoveries about mars that could provide proof that there is life on the red planet
 
we were drawn to this site because it looked like it could host some of the key ingredients for habitability water heat and nutrients joseph levy explained the site they are most interested in is a strangely shaped depression that was probably formed by a volcano beneath a glacier this is an exciting discovery because researchers now believe it could have been a warm chemicalrich environment exactly what is needed for lifeforms to evolve
related articles
what are these vshaped formations doing on mars
nasa flys by enceladus and finds mysterious formations what are these things
 
the site is inside a crater perched on the rim of the hellas basin in an area surrounded by ancient glacial deposits levy first thought it might be significant in 2009 when he noticed it contained cracklike features in several photographs he realized that they resembled so called ice cauldrons on earth which are often found in iceland and greenland these ice cauldrons occur when a volcano erupts underneath an ice sheet photos also reveal another depression in the galaxias fossae region of mars had a similar appearance
 
img srchttpsciencevibecomwpcontentuploads201709mars768x445jpg
 
these landforms caught our eye because theyre weird looking theyre concentrically fractured so they look like a bullseye that can be a very diagnostic pattern you see in earth materials said levy who first observed the photos when he was a postdoctoral researcher at portland state universitythe big contribution of the study was that we were able to measure not just their shape and appearance but also how much material was lost to form the depressions that 3d view lets us test this idea of volcanic or impact levy saidthat surprised us and led to a lot of thinking about whether it meant there was melting concentrated in the center that removed ice and allowed stuff to pour in from the sides or if you had an impact crater did you start with a much smaller crater in the past and by sublimating away ice youve expanded the apparent size of the crater levy said
 
here is an example of a similar ice cauldron on earth
 
img srchttpsnewsutexasedusitesnewsutexasedufilesice_cauldronjpg
 
however after running simulations of formation scenarios fro the two depressions researchers concluded that they probably formed in different ways the debris in the area around the galaxias fossae depression suggests that it was the result of an impact from an asteroid although the volcanic history of the area means that volcanic origins should not be ruled out
 
in contrast the hellas depression shows a significant number of signs of volcanic origins it lacks the surrounding debris that would be caused by an impact and has a fracture pattern associated with concentrated removal of ice by melting or sublimation under the surface which could only be cause by a great heat source
 
ice cauldrons have been formed on earth before as shown in this video
 
 
the reason this discovery is so interesting is that the interaction of lava and ice would have created an environment with liquid water and chemical nutrients which are both required ingredients for life as it is known on earth levy explained that the hellas depression and to a lesser extent the galaxias fossae depression should be places of special interest as scientists and amateurs alike continue to look for habitats and life on mars
 
gro pedersen a volcanologist at the university of iceland who was not involved with the study agreed that these sites are a major find and that they are likely to lead to more discoveries in the future
 
these features do really resemble ice cauldrons known from earth and just from that perspective they should be of great interest pedersen said both because their existence may provide information on the properties of subsurface material the potential existence of ice and because of the potential for revealing icevolcano interactions
 
hopefully in the near future the truth will come forth about what might be under all of that ice it certainly seems that the possibility of life on mars is quite real

"__label__fake the plan to beat pittsburgh
before its news
offense
openspace tackling drill
the theme of the steelers clash with chicago was their shoddy tackling time and time again the pittsburgh backers and defensive backs struggled to contain what should have been minimal gains in the open field the bears didnt challenge the steelers downfield because they didnt have to short dumpoffs and underneath crossers got the job done
now for a ravens offense that lives off the check down this seems to be the perfect scenario however there are two issues the backs and receivers simply havent been making defenders miss tackles with any level of consistency and as we saw last week against the jaguars opposing linebackers are all over the short underneath passes the ravens run the jacksonville lbs sat on those routes in thirddown passing situations
thats not to say there isnt an opportunity to exploit the steelers shaky openfield tackling but offensive coordinator mart mornhinweg has to be better like a twoman pickandroll basketball scheme he needs to give his playmakers a chance to work off picks and clear outs to break loose in particular he needs to get speed receivers mike wallace and breshad perriman in the open field working underneath on slants and crossers that get them matched up with the pittsburgh defensive backs in trail coverage
the steelers were also gashed by tailback tarik cohen in space naturally that sets up well for buck allen but allen really isnt a shakeandbake back like cohen hes more of a slasher give him the ball in space through coordinated screens and underneath routes that enable him to follow blockers and hell have a better chance to gain yards in the open field
livin on the edge
the bears ground game against pittsburgh wasnt overly sophisticated they mostly did their damage off cutback runs in which the steelers front line was washed down chasing the playside only to lose backside contain chicago set up that cutback action by running left and cutting back inside the leftside perimeter run game was so successful it forced the steelers to overcommit at times and they couldnt maintain their gap integrity
to this point weve seen plenty of the outside zone stretch run to the weakside from the ravens rungame arsenal baltimore had success creasing the browns two weeks ago with offtackle runs however the mix of backside cutbacks hasnt been as prevalent the backs have mostly stayed frontside to ride out their outside blocks
mixing in backside cutback opportunities certainly makes sense in light of the steelers struggles to handle those types of runs but the counters should be plentiful with the tight ends actively involved on perimeter wham and pull blocks overall rungame coordinator greg roman has done a nice job using his tight ends as motion and pull blockers on lead iso runs
alex collins should be the feature guy when the ravens are in run mode from their base sets collins has a lightning burst to the edge hes their best bet to stress the steelers perimeter run defense
flip the script
mornhinwegs early down playcalling patterns werecuriousto the least you would think the firstdown production would be atrocious given how many threeandouts the offense had in the early part of the game against jacksonville but on three of their first four drives the offense had gains of four five and four yards thats optimal for firstdown production
so what happened on second down the ravens threw the ball and had incompletions they went to the gun and tried to spread out the jaguars and their passing attack sputtered even in a key thirdandtwo conversion opportunity mornhinweg opted to throw the ball instead of trying to run it
granted this is a small sample size to harp on and the defense was buried by scores each time the offense was forced off the field so that didnt help with the game script but mornhinweg needs to reign in the open formations from the gun in those shortyardage conversion situations and give his depleted offensive line a chance to compete the offense needs to be able to stay on the field to keep the pittsburgh offense on the sidelines
defense
cloud coverage mashups
last sunday the bears defensive focus was to eliminate the big play from the pittsburgh offense they deterred ben roethlisberger from airing it out deep using a mix of cover 3 coverages three deep four under with an assortment of cloud coverage mixed in
in the cloud setup the safeties roll to the deepest thirds of the field along with one of the corners typically the right corner the left corner will jam and pass off the opposing receiver to the strong safety this type of cloud is geared to take away the 9route in pittsburghs offense that means martavis bryant the bears stifled bryant all day as the dynamic wr finished with just 30 yards receiving
in the past dean pees has used his own variations of zone coverage to keep roethlisberger from airing it out deep if he employs the same cloud coverage that the bears used the safeties cant make mistakes in their assignments as they did against jacksonville in addition tackling will need to be at a premium but if they can maintain their backend discipline this is a coverage scheme that can keep pittsburgh bottled up
dime defense
the toughest part about facing the steelers is figuring out the right personnel package to line up in from the opening snap given that pittsburgh lines up in so many fourreceiver sets defenses are basically forced to keep a nickel defense on the field at all times which is tough because the steelers instantly gain the edge to face a lighter front and run the ball with leveon bell however teams also need to have an answer for bells ability to detach from the formation and line up as a wide receiver if you play a 42 front with two inside linebackers on the field bell will have the mismatch in oneonone situations outside or hell eat up soft zone coverage underneath
thats why the dime defense featuring anthony levine as an ilb would be the ravens best personnel bet in this matchup yes the ravens would sacrifice some of their brute strength against the run but the reality is kamalei correa and patrick onwausor havent exactly been enforcers and both players are liabilities in coverage because theyve dropped too deep and missed tackles
the ravens will need levines versatility to match up against bell and talented rookie slot man juju smithschuster with six dbs on the field cj mosley would also be freed up to rush and spy big ben
delayed blitz action from static looks
theres always a classic catandmouse game between pees and roethlisberger in obvious passing situations pees has confused big ben at times using his amoeba looks in which the front defenders are all standing up aside from one down lineman from this look defenders will bluff out of the blitz or come but its been tough for the future halloffamer to discern whos coming and whos bluffing
these defensive fronts have better potential for breaking through against spread looks like the fourwide packages the steelers run overload blitzes are especially effective and the bears were able to get home a few times to pressure big ben
however to this point in the season pees hasnt been showing as many of those exotic standup formations he flashed some of those looks against the bengals but has dialed out of it when facing the browns and jaguars spread looks the result has been a static defense that doesnt move around before the snap
the bears had success using a static presnap approach in which the defenders didnt move until after the ball was snapped once the ball was snapped defensive coordinator vic fangio did a nice job of using delayed blitz action to attack pittsburghs open sets
pees can continue to run static looks but he should incorporate delayed blitz action after the snap when you consider that bell is so involved as a receiver out of the backfield there will be some chances to attack the pittsburgh front five after theyve declared their blocking assignments
oneonone matchup to watch
there are other corners in the nfl who get the notoriety that smith doesnt get but when hes healthy hes a shutdown corner plain and simple against brown smith has had some of his best performances holding the best receiver in the game to 61 yards and 85 yards in their last two encounters brown is used all over the field so itll be tough for smith to track him on every play but when theyre matched up outside the numbers smith will need to pin brown to the sideline and use his length to disrupt the wideouts timing

"__label__real its sad that a manager and even some players are looked at differently because they dont have a world series or an nba championship behind their name said the nationals bench coach chris speier who also worked with baker in chicago and cincinnati i dont feel that anybody should be judged because they havent done it you look at their track record over all wherever hes gone hes proven hes a winner
baker stayed three more seasons with the cubs after they lost the 2003 national league pennant to the marlins who infamously scored eight runs in the eighth inning of a game 6 comeback in the nlcs a cubs fan deflected a catchable foul ball a shortstop made an error a bunch of marlins got hits the warmedover details are wellknown here
but if baker still felt connected to the cubs it did not show up in his rooting interest last fall after the nationals lost by one run to the los angeles dodgers in the fifth game of their division series baker watched the world series as a neutral observer he had friends with both the cleveland indians and the cubs
i was neither rooting for them nor against them baker said sunday of the cubs i was just rooting for a good game because i didnt have any skin in the game and im not a gambler i just wanted a good game and thats what we got we got some good games

in a way bakers pursuit of a title mirrors his teams washington has won a world series before and so has baker but both were much different then the washington team that won it was the senators a precursor to the minnesota twins in 1925 when baker won it in 1981 he played left field for the dodgers
this is bakers 14th trip to the postseason four as a player one as a coach nine as a manager and he does not change with the seasons
same as always its dusty said max scherzer washingtons game 3 starter who insists his sore right hamstring can withstand 100 pitches on monday hes always got a great story for you somehow some way he keeps everybody loose everybody laughing nothings really changed
the cubs had a light optional workout on sunday morning with many players appearing on the field only to sample the breakfast arranged on the warning track behind the plate joe maddon the cubs irreverent manager has done this before in october complete with an nfl game on the video board maddon wore a joe namath jersey in the clubhouse though he made no guarantees for his team
were not there yet he said smiling
the nationals held an afternoon workout with no food or football in sight everyone took batting practice or fielded balls in the outfield just as they would in the regular season the cubs offbeat vibe is not bakers style

"__label__real washington texas cnn for generations city slickers have lived out their old west fantasies on texas dude ranches but the newly updated inn at dos brisas halfway between houston and austin offers much more than dusty cattle drives and campfire cookouts
tucked away in the rolling hills of washington county on a former cotton plantation the inn features large luxurious cabins a gourmet farmtotable restaurant and a 7000bottle wine cellar
the lavish resort does not however forsake the desire guests may have to enjoy an authentic texan experience
not only does the 313acre getaway draw produce eggs and herbs from its onsite usdacertified organic farm but dos brisas also boasts one of the lone star states top equestrian centers with a large indoor arena and horseback riding for all levels
the inn at dos brisas the name translates to two breezes started out as a family retreat for the wellheeled houstonbased investor doug bosch and his wife jennifer but soon after they bought the property in 2000 the couple recognized its potential to become a posh guest ranch which opened in 2004
going back for more than a century the land has seen a variety of uses in addition to cotton farms it previously housed confederate soldiers and also was a cattle ranch
as the bosches undertook renovations they were initially inspired to establish a foodie destination hiring renowned talent from outside of texas and tilling their first fields their vision soon expanded to include overnight hospitality
fresh talent seasonal flavors
the resorts own organic farm drives menus at the forbes fivestar restaurant
for six months at the start of 2016 dos brisas was temporarily shuttered for an overhaul which included extensive makeovers for the kitchen and dining room
new hires included chef matt padilla a parttime texan who worked overseas at noma in denmark one of the most highly touted restaurants in western europe before joining the 5star kitchen at element 47 at the little nell in aspen colorado
the emphasis on seasonal local ingredients was one of the things that pulled padilla south from the mountains we try to focus on whats available on the farm first he says i love being in a place where the seasons are constantly changing
padilla coordinates extensively with the inns farm manager steve king a former horticulture professor at texas am university 30 miles to the north
king is a hearty arkansas native who in addition to teaching had been selling heirloom tomatoes at local farmers markets before he joined the dos brisas team currently he oversees 42 acres of fields rotating numerous crops across smaller plots to defeat pests and promote sustainability as well as a 7000squarefoot stateoftheart greenhouse
this is one of the few places where the restaurant is actually on the farm king muses and what we have is a real farm not a simple garden its hard work
menu items change frequently as different fruits and vegetables reach their peak often combined in dishes that are a nouveau texaseuropean hybrid dreamed up by padilla who has trained with french and italian masters
gulf seafood local venison and handselected cheeses from area producers compliment the freshly harvested crops the chefs wife tara padilla a trained sommelier oversees the bar program which includes cocktails infused with herbs from the inn
all the hard work and attention to detail pays off the inn is the only restaurant in the state of texas to earn five stars from the forbes travel guide
luxury in the birthplace of texas
1 6 wide expanses are a big draw at the inn at dos brisas a 313acre resort about an hour and a half from houston
dos brisas guests can take in panoramas of the farm and surrounding country from one of the 750squarefoot tileroof casitas or from one of five spacious reproduction colonial mission haciendas
the latter completed in 2011 impress with 3000 square feet of amenities including cathedralceiling timber interiors overstuffed leather furniture gas fireplaces with electronic ignition cavernous showers screened porches and outdoor plunge pools on a private patio
constructed as sidebyside duplexes the more intimate romantic casitas have interior thrudoors that expand them to suites
as dos brisas has expanded the inns unique texas character and rustic yet upscale approach to hospitality made it a natural fit for membership with relais chateaux an association of independent hospitality companies
the area has long been a regional crossroads playing a crucial role in texas history in 1836 the texas declaration of independence was signed 10 miles from the inn on the banks of the nearby brazos river in the wake of the infamous battle of the alamo in san antonio that document established the republic of texas and to this day washington county continues to be regarded as the birthplace of texas
interested visitors can even swing by the official washingtononthebrazos historic site just 10 miles from dos brisas the star of the republic museum and the barrington living history farm where staff in period costumes offer daily tours
outdoor adventures
riding is the resorts most popular outdoor pursuit
activities at dos brisas offer additional diversions
rain or shine horseback riding is the most popular pastime with miles of trails over the hills and through the woods
despite houstons wellearned reputation for sprawl a little over an hour away the only signs of development riders will encounter are a few fences and the occasional outbuilding dappled trails trace pasture edges and visit some of the farm fields where bluebirds flit in and out of houses affixed to wooden posts
there is a jumping course for experts and a longer more challenging woodland routes for more advanced riders with 31 horses dos brisas offers the second largest private indoor equestrian arena in texas
for those who prefer to sit back and relax the inn has an oldfashioned buggy that gets pulled by the resident clydesdale named samson while all of the rooms come with a golf cart for sweatfree conveyance around the grounds
there are stocked bass ponds for anglers cooking classes for budding epicureans and loaner bikes for those who want to pedal the historic back roads
the clayshooting program offers another opportunity to sample a little bit of cowboy culture head wrangler valerie darlington and her staff cheerfully set guests up with a 12 or 20gauge shotgun safety goggles and ear protection and offer pointers so that even beginners can knock down the highflying brightorange clays
all of which represent fine ways to work up an appetite which at the end of the day remains the reason most travelers head for dos brisas the resort this year for the first time is accepting bookings seven days a week
the more genteel touches highlight a fresh 21stcentury twist on what a dude ranch can be but the inn at dos brisas hits its target with an accuracy that an oldtime texas sharpshooter would certainly appreciate"
"__label__fake for second week in row jets youngsters shine
before its news
coming off the heels of a 206 victory against the miami dolphins in a game that some felt could end up being their only win of the season the jets came out and looked fantastic on defense once again while their suddenly explosive offense did enough to get them a 2320 win in overtime
we talked about the lengthy list of outstanding performers last week and the list is equally impressive this week so without further ado the jets top players from yesterdays win
dl kony ealy according to pffcom ealy was the first defensive lineman to have four batted passes in a game since 2015 ealy also came away with an interception on a ball that he tipped straight up in the air ealy also added 3 quarterback pressures it was an outstanding effort from ealy we would later learn was dealing the the death of his sister earlier in the week you cant say enough about the effort he gave under those circumstances
rbs bilal powell and elijah mcguire
we could list them individually as powell and mcguire were both fantastic combining for 256 yards on 31 carries an average of 82 yards per carry powells long of 75 yards was the secondlongest run in team history and mcguire added a 69yard scamper of his own
elijah mcguire had 131 yards from scrimmage 93 rushing38 receiving
s jamal adams
once again adams was all over the field and seemingly flawless in coverage in a 5 tackle performance 3 solo his career is only four games old but its clear to any objective observer that hes going to be a great one hes been used as a box safety a coverage safety a man cornerback and a linebacker he has done all with no problems whatsoever
s marcus maye
while maye was steady in run support leading all dbs with 5 tackles the safety is also a big reason why the jets secondary has been so much better than the unit that was abysmal last season in 2016 the jets secondary allowed seven td passes of 40 yards or more and four of those came in their first four games through four games this season the longest opposing td pass was jay cutlers 3yard toss that came as time expired last week maye is a big reason for that
lbfb lawrence thomas
over the past two weeks thomas has gone from rotational defensive lineman to key versatile contributor a former college fullback thomas has gotten some reps there over the past two weeks and has absolutely blown up defenders to spring jets backs for big runs credit to john morton for adding this wrinkle to his attack because now a team that was thought to have no fullback at all may have a pretty good one in thomas
leonard williams has been a big part of the jets improved defense over the past two weeks
dl leonard williams
once again williams failed to get to the quarterback but he was in on 7 tackles 3 solo with several coming within a yard or two of the line of scrimmage hes still playing on a bum wrist but williams improvement since a stinker in week two is a big reason why the jets defense has given up just two touchdowns in the last two weeks
olb david bass
having mentioned the impact of leonard williams above you cant not show some love to david bass who the team singed just a couple of weeks ago for the second time in as many weeks bass was a factor coming off the edge and came away with multiple pressures and a sack you can add bass to a list of impressive lowrisk acquisitions who are paying big dividends for the jets at the moment
brent qvale
the entire oline deserves a ton of credit in this game but qvale was a concern coming in for his first start of the season against jacksonvilles front seven which is viewed as one of the best in the nfl minus a couple of hiccups josh mccown had plenty of time to throw throughout the day and the run game was dominant the tone was set on the first drive when despite not coming away with any points the jets line stonewalled the jaguars pass rush and qvale was a big part of that you knew if the line held up that well the rest of the way the jets were going to have a shot
wr robby anderson
no andersons stat line wont blow you away 3 receptions 59 yards but he smoked an elite corner in aj bouye for a 41yard catch and continues to show he can make plays against opposing teams top cornerbacks not half bad for an undrafted free agent in his second season
its been said time and again over the past several months that this season is about the development of this teams young players as it turns out theyre developing a bit faster than many anticipated and now theyve got a shot to be over 500 at 32 if they can beat the cleveland browns on the road next sunday enjoy it while it lasts jets fans
you can discuss this with other ny jets fans on the jet nation message board or visit of on facebook

"__label__real image copyright getty images image caption a child gets sucked down a drain by a scary clown
earlier this month horror movie it based on the stephen king novel was released in cinemas you may well have seen it
but surely only the bravest among you wouldve gone to the immersive screenings of the movie
such fans wouldve had the pleasure of a reallife pennywise the clown creeping round the auditorium during the film jumping out at them from behind and basically scaring the living daylights out of everyone there
while many of us may think this sounds like the most utterly hideous experience in the world not everyone feels that way immersive horror is becoming quite a thing
theres huge growth in this area says simon oakes ceo of british horror brand hammer who have just premiered their first immersive show the soulless ones
image copyright hammer image caption hammers immersive shows contemporary look is a far cry from that of its gothic horrors of the 1950s70s
its a generational thing newer audiences want something thats more tangible emotional more physical an experience which is different from the promenade shows that you wouldve seen before or even traditional theatre
as anybody who has been to the cinema in the last decade knows many people struggle to go for more than about fourandahalf minutes without checking their whatsapp so the appeal of immersive theatre may be down to being totally engrossed in something and disconnected from the outside world
of course weve seen hugely popular immersive shows before with the likes of punchdrunk and you me bum bum train
theres a whole generation of younger audiences who are excited about the idea of being involved in a story rather than told it says oscar blustin the cowriter and codirector of the soulless ones
i think gaming has a lot to do with it and how young audiences expect things to be interactive
image copyright pa image caption now who wouldnt want this friendly chap jumping out at them in a dark cinema
when you watch tv weve all shouted at the screen dont go in there or dont go upstairs i think artists are recognising that this can engage audiences more with the narrative
in the case of the soulless ones simon says we wanted to come up with something completely original
with something like the great gatsby or alice in wonderland the audience knows what theyre going to get if you know the show youve already bought into what the creative expectation might be
so we chose to start with a completely new show this isnt a frankenstein or dracula so as a story its original
horror is arguably the genre which provides the most potential to create an immersive experience for theatregoers
i think thats because its able to shed a light on your deepest fears says simon
image copyright getty images image caption stephen king wrote it immersive screenings of which have been terrifying audiences
we dont want to frighten people and scare people as much as unsettle them but its not a jumpscare performance which a lot of the modern horror films are
the general philosophy behind horror is that if you dont care about the people you dont care about what happens to them and with the great genre directors like kubrick and hitchcock you were invested in the characters
while the immersive screenings of stephen kings it were just a few special ones organised to promote the film the soulless ones has a residency at hoxton hall in london from this week until 31 october
oscar explains the show is about a hive of vampires who are trying to perform a ritual which will let them walk in the daylight its our take on the vampire legend
that is the overarching story but there are 14 characters and 1820 different rooms around the building they all interweave and interlink its a patchwork of narrative threads
that may sound a little overwhelming but simon argues one key aspect of the shows appeal is the potential for repeat visits
image copyright hammer image caption the soulless ones has a residency in hoxton hall for the month of october
because of the number of rooms weve got 14 hours in total of prepared material he says
and i hope thats one of the reasons people might want to see it again youd comfortably be able to see the show four times and never see the same show twice if you were clever about the route you take
whichever room you walk into youll get a different side of the same story
oscar points out that audiences would struggle to play with their phones during performances even if they wanted to mostly because the victorian music hall were performing in has absolutely no signal
and if fans enjoy the experience it could well lead to other similar projects
were not like marvel or dc comics says simon at hammer we feel immersive theatre is an intriguing part of what we do in terms of creating intellectual property
but what we do have is a place in this area if its successful to be a building block to others
oscar adds people are so on the hunt for unique and oneoff experiences in particular
theres so much to talk about with immersive theatre audiences who can compare notes on what theyve seen and the different experience theyve had at the same show
in the bar afterwards im anticipating a lot of what did you see conversations

orange was stacees favorite color and on friday after people bought as much orange ribbon as they could find at all the local craft stores an army tied ribbons all around town from the trees on downtowns grant avenue to the posts in front of pioneer park my wife and her friends tied them around the trees in front of the middle school where stacees daughter goes to school along with mine

i missed it all i was as close to the site of the shooting as you could get and yet felt fully disconnected from the effect of the tragedy one night i walked to the memorial that sprang up in the median of south las vegas boulevard the kind of nowfamiliar postshooting memorial that i saw at columbine almost two decades before with balloons and flowers and candles i found a photo of stacee that had been placed in the middle of it all and took a picture and sent it home
in las vegas stacee was just one in a crowd part of a list but she and her family were all anyone talked or thought about back in novato and that is where i got my news i heard that stacees husband a san francisco police officer was running with stacee through the barrage of gunfire when he stopped to help someone he told his wife to go on and never saw her alive again i heard that television news trucks were parked in front of the house i heard stories of friends pulling over in their cars to cry at the weight and nearness of it all there were beautiful and crushingly sad facebook posts in stacees honor the kind you see after every tragedy except these were written by people i knew well
i heard my wife who grew up in a nearby town tell me that she had never been more proud to call novato home
i checked out of that mandalay bay suite on saturday morning excused from reporting duties and flew home in the hopes of making my daughters soccer game i found the red rose from the vigil starting to fade and wilt in a vase on the kitchen counter when we got to the game we and the other parents were somewhat surprised to see stacees husband and extended family there too warming up with the girls was no 8 with her long ponytail
we all wore orange ribbons attached by safety pins including the girls on both teams the novato team wore orange armbands with the initials se before kickoff both squads came across the field to the spectator side and lined up in straight lines our teams coach asked the parents to stand for 30 seconds of silence and then two of the leagues better teams played a rather meaningless soccer game only this one felt about as meaningful as anything ive ever watched
and it was late in the second half when the ball suddenly swung from one end to the other and stacees daughter gave chase through three retreating opponents and beat them all to the ball and in one blinkandyoumissedit moment she booted the ball into the corner of the net for what held on as the winning goal
advertisement continue reading the main story
her teammates chased her and swarmed her and they and she looked as free and happy as girls can be on a sunny fall saturday afternoon with their friends the parents jumped and cheered as loudly as ive heard parents cheer at a kids soccer game behind my sunglasses i was bawling it was the first time id cried all week"

the washington post owned by the same man who owns amazon jeff bezos failed to cover the recent nearly 300 million dollar fine against the corporate retail giant blacking out the story that its bosss other organization reaped illegal tax benefits for 8 long years
amazon was ordered by the european commission to pay the fine after it was found to have received illegal tax benefits
the commission stated that amazon received the illegal benefits between 2006 and 2014 in the country without any valid justification
luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to amazon as a result almost threequarters of amazons profits were not taxed margrethe vestager the eus commissioner for competition said in a statement
in other words amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules this is illegal under eu state aid rules member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others she added
amazon tax benefits in luxembourg are illegal under our common european rules on state aid amazon to repay benefits worth around 250 mio margrethe vestager vestager october 4 2017
300 million fine against amazon for tax dodge in eunothing on washington post front page matt drudge tweeted wednesday adding a mocking comment of wapos catchphrase democracy dies in darkness democracy dieswith monopolistic bezos drudge tweeted
300m fine against amazon for tax dodge in eu nothing on httpstcoxovevz1tgf front page democracy dies with monopolistic bezos matt drudge drudge october 4 2017
amazon said in response to the commissions decision that it believes it did not receive any special treatment from luxembourg that it paid tax in full accordance with both luxembourg and international tax law and was considering an appeal
we will study the commissions ruling and consider our legal options including an appeal our 50000 employees across europe remain headsdown focused on serving our customers and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses who work with us the online retailing giant said in a statement to bloomberg
us president donald trump has previously accused bezos of tax dodging in several tweets and while on fox during his run for the presidency last year
he thinks ill go after him for antitrust trump told fox news sean hannity last year because hes got a huge antitrust problem because hes controlling so much amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing hes using the washington post which is peanuts hes using that for political purposes to save amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust he added
the amazonwashingtonpost sometimes referred to as the guardian of amazon not paying internet taxes which they should is fake news donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 28 2017
the washingtonpost which loses a fortune is owned by jeffbezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company amazon donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 7 2015
trumps claim that amazon pays no internet taxes is partially true and is therefore fake news
while its true that the online retailer built its huge market share via tax avoidance amazon began collecting sales tax nationwide on april 1st earlier this year
the luxembourg government stated it considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid
the ruling is further indication that the eu is finally going after big corporations for tax dodging
last year apple was ordered to pay 145 billion in back taxes just like amazon
the eu authority further announced that it was suing ireland for failing to recover any money from that fine from apple inc
ireland has to recover up to 13 billion euros in illegal state aid from apple however more than one year after the commission adopted this decision ireland has still not recovered the money also not in part said vestager in a statement she added we of course understand that recovery in certain cases may be more complex than in others and we are always ready to assist but member states need to make sufficient progress to restore competition that is why we have today decided to refer ireland to the eu court for failing to implement our decision
additionally earlier this year google was ordered to pay 27 billion dollars by vestager earlier this year in an antitrust lawsuit for promoting its own shopping service over rivals
while google also faced a 170 million dollar fine last year from british tax authorities and agreed to pay that lump sum in back taxes for all the years the company under paid

"__label__real story highlights defense secretary james mattis spoke about the challenge publicly for the first time tuesday
the impact is already being felt on troop deployments to afghanistan
cnn the extended deployment of military cargo jets and navy ships to help with hurricane maria and hurricane irma relief efforts is causing military planners to scramble and recalculate future deployments all the way from afghanistan to the korean peninsula according to several defense officials familiar with discussions underway inside the defense department
due to security concerns officials refused to discuss specific changes in deployment timelines or the units involved but sketched out how they could impact overseas deployments into 2018
defense secretary james mattis spoke about the challenge publicly for the first time tuesday testifying before the senate armed services committee that the military will stay in puerto rico as long as needed we are ready to go even to the point that its going to impact the deployments perhaps of some of these troops overseas next year because weve interrupted their preparation
the impact is already being felt on troop deployments to afghanistan planners are considering several solutions including delays for troops scheduled to deploy either as part of the additional 3500 troops being sent or to replace existing forces
forces scheduled to come home may not be able to leave afghanistan until their replacements arrive and some departing troops may have to leave equipment behind until aircraft can be sent to pick it up

"__label__fake and that is only the official estimation
 
many were aware of the potential danger of the asteroid florence which barely missed earth on september 1st and fell into a false sense of security however it is time to start paying attention again
 
nasa announced that an object they named 2012 tc4 is heading towards the earth and is expected to make its approach on october 12th new yorkers will be closer to the object officially named 2012 tc4 than to tokyo
 
compare a possible impact to a watermelon being shot with a bb gun

although it is slightly smaller than florence this will not help very much because it is much denser even denser than granite and it is moving faster
 
2012 tc4 is thousands of times heavier than the chelyabinsk meteorite that devastated an entire russian city based on public records it will make the closest approach to earth of any other asteroid of its size
 
compare a possible impact to a watermelon being shot with a bb gun in this case earth is the watermelon and the bb gun is 2012 tc4 it would penetrate the crust and get into the magma causing magma splashes and massive volcanic eruptions now imagine 2012 tc4 landing on texas
 
nasas planetary defense system will be put to the test on october 12
 
 
based on the official numbers from nasa the probability of an impact is 1 in 600 however more disturbing information has been uncovered
 
in what could not reasonably be a coincidence nasa is holding doomsday exercises on october 12th the exact date that the asteroid is supposed to miss the earth it is quite possible that these are not exercises at all but rather preparations although it is likely that few people have any real protection from this event those who do have a plan may want to consider it the government may simply be keeping this information under wraps to avoid panic

"__label__real file photo brazils senator aecio neves speaks during a statement to defend himself against corruption charges where he resumed his mandate with the authorization of the federal supreme court in brasilia brazil july 4 2017 reutersueslei marcelino
brasilia reuters brazils supreme court on wednesday decided to grant congress the final word on decisions to remove a sitting politician conceding a victory to lawmakers fighting to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption
the narrow 65 decision will allow the senate to vote next week to revoke a top court ruling that suspended senator aecio neves who is being investigated in seven corruption cases
a majority of the justices decided to back off from confrontation with congress in the midst of brazils biggest political corruption scandal which has even implicated president michel temer and his inner circle of cabinet ministers
the lower house of congress is expected to vote later this month to shelve charges against temer in a corruption case involving meatpacker jbs sa saving him from trial by the supreme court
more than 110 politicians are targeted by the sprawling car wash graft investigation that has uncovered since 2014 a massive network of bribes and kickbacks paid by companies seeking to win government contracts and influence legislation

congress has pushed back against judicial action by the supreme court since the justices ordered the removal of the former speaker of the lower house eduardo cunha who was arrested last year convicted of corruption and sentenced to more than 15 years in prison for corruption
one third of the politicians in brazils congress more than 230 including more than half of its senators are being investigated for breaking the law and face trial by the supreme court the only court that can try lawmakers and ministers
those being investigated include the presidents of the senate and the lower house and many of the leaders of temers governing coalition
in another gain for the political class the supreme court ruled on tuesday that no one can be charged merely on the basis of plea bargain testimony by just one witness if no evidence is provided to back up the accusation
plea deals have been the main tool used by anticorruption prosecutors to track the network of political kickbacks and dismantle graft schemes discovered at oil company petrobras and other staterun enterprises
the ruling was part of a decision to throw out corruption and money laundering charges against senator renan calheiros the former president of the senate who faces seven other graft investigations"

"__label__real milan reuters spanish shares rebounded sharply in a flat european market on wednesday on hopes that a big political crisis in the euro zones fourth largest economy could deescalate after catalonia stopped short of declaring formal independence from madrid
while spains benchmark ibex ibex rose 13 percent the paneuropean stoxx 600 index ended flat and the euro zone blue chip index stoxx50e inched up 02 percent
spanish stocks have lagged their european peers this month with an 09 percent fall on worries of a possible breakup of the country following catalonias independence referendum on oct 1 that madrid had deemed unconstitutional
concerns however eased after the regions separatist leader made only a symbolic declaration triggering a response from the spanish prime minister that could deepen the confrontation but also signals a possible way out of the crisis
european equities have broadly brushed off the spanish tensions while the fall on the ibex remains limited the madrid index is still up more than 10 percent so far this year
for the wider european economy and probably even the wider spanish economy i dont see huge risk at the moment and you see that in the muted market reaction said marcus morriseyton european equities portfolio manager at allianz global investors
marcus morriseytons two spanish holdings are zara owner inditex itxmc and information technology supplier amadeus amamc two global companies which he said have little domestic spanish exposure and are unlikely to be much affected by political developments
inditex added 13 percent and amadeus rose 08 percent

ilb darron lee vs rb duke johnson
the browns rank 28th in the nfl in points per game at 158 with struggling rookie quarterback deshone kizer under center over his past three games kizer has completed just 47 of his passes with 33 of those going to running back duke johnson on short routes just beyond the line of scrimmage if kizer struggles to complete passes down the field once again the browns may be forced to continue having him dump the ball off over the middle where lee will likely be matched up with johnson
dl muhammad wilkerson vs lg joe bitonio
bitonio is a highly thought of interior lineman but looked vulnerable last week against the cincinnati bengals muhammad wilkerson is playing with a bum shoulder and an alarming lack of effort if he decides to show up and play he could make some noise if wilkersons effort is lacking once again bitonio may have himself an easy time opening up running lanes on his side for duke johnson and isaiah crowell
wr robby anderson vs cb jason mccourty
mccourty is playing at a high level for the struggling browns and is currently the sixth ranked cornerback in the nfl per pro football focus mccourty was used almost exclusively on wide receiver aj green last week in a game that saw green have moderate production 4 rec63 ydstd with his lone score coming against rookie safety jabrill peppers mccourty will be an excellent test for anderson whom josh mccown will likely look toward when looking to make a big play down the field
jets pass rush vs deshone kizer
kizer currently owns the worst quarterback rating in the nfl at 509 on film there are several glaring weaknesses but one that jumps out is how long he holds on the ball when his protection holds up and his hesitancy to pull the trigger even when he has an open receiver he has taken some unnecessary sacks in the early going 11 total and his 8 interceptions lead the league at least three of those interceptions were the fault of his receivers who failed to hold on but kizer has also seen several passes go in and out of the hands of opposing defensive backs if the jets pass rush can get to kizer and rattle him early they should be able to force multiple turnovers
lt kelvin beachum vs de myles garrett
garrett is ready to finally make his professional debut and theres no reason to expect the no 1 pick in the draft to be anything but fired up beachum has been below average at left tackle thus far and if garretts explosiveness translates at the pro level he could have a big day in his pro debut
te austin seferianjenkins vs s jabrill peppers
seferianjenkins hasnt been targeted as much as jets fans might like but when mccown has come his way hes come up big the big tight end has come down with some jump balls that required full extension in traffic one of the leagues best resurrection stories could be in for a big day if he gets matched up with a struggling peppers who is currently ranked 80th among nfl safeties by pff
prediction
jets 20 browns 10
stranger things have happened but in watching the browns offense operate over the first four weeks its difficult to imagine them finding a way to put points on the board their lone touchdown last week came late in the game when backup quarterback kevin hogan was inserted for kizer and marched cleveland down the field for a score

"__label__fake blackhawks at detroit 42 win recap
before its news
first game at little caesars arena
as we inch closer to the regular season we saw a nice win for the blackhawks in the preseason in their second to last game of the preseason we saw them play a young detroit team missing many of their bigname players the blackhawks were also missing key players like kane saad seabrook keith and crawford in their first appearance at little caesars arena the red wings new facility the hawks won 42
the first period started a little slow and with some sloppy plays but things would start to get better pretty quick at 454 we saw the first of 10 penalties in the game when red wing robbie russo slashed gustav forsling the power play was just ok early on but got better in the later periods of the game shortly after at 823 we would see the first of the blackhawks penalty kill unit because of a laurent dauphin tripping penalty on the pp the red wings had what looked like a sure goal when ben street shot at a sprawling anton forsberg with a wideopen net the shot went high and hit the crossbar later the blackhawks would go on the penalty kill 2 more times after a david kampf interference call and a tomas jurco slashing call
the second period started with the red wings on the power play where they scored the first goal of the game justin abdelkader had the puck down down low and passed to niklas kronwall at the blue line kronwall would let a shot go that red wings rookie michael rasmussen nicely redirected past anton forsberg the period went on seeing a couple good shifts from the makeshift second line of artem anisimov john hayden and vinnie hinostroza we saw anisimov put the puck through a defenders legs to a stuff attempt and john hayden have a good shot attempt which resulted in artem anisimov getting robbed on the rebound with a wideopen net no scoring would come till late in the period
at 1350 richard panik got the blackhawks on the board and tied the game alex debrincat held the puck at the line and tapped it to an open jonathan toews who would make a great crossice pass to a wide open richard panik panik sent a onetimer past petr mrazek the wings would take the lead back about two minutes later when libor sulak put a shot past a sliding connor murphy to the glove side of forsberg
the third period is where the blackhawks hit their stride at the 141 mark of the third period tanner kero chipped a pass to a streaking vince hinostroza who weaved through two defenders hinostroza then sent a slick backhand pass to tommy wingels on the back door who put a well placed onetimer past petr mrazek next the highly anticipated alex debrincat would score his second preseason goal on the power play as the wings sulak was given a twominute minor for hooking against laurent dauphin after taking a pass from gustav forsling debrincat then made a nice backhanded pass to defenseman cody franson franson looked to pass the puck to jonathan toews but the pass went all the way through the crease to back to debrincat who let go a nice wrist shot over mrazek the red wings would challenge the goal for offsides but failed resulting in the hawks going on another power play for those unaware new this year a failed offsides challenge results in a twominute minor for delay of game instead of just losing a timeout the final goal of the game would come at 1835 when laurent dauphin made a nice steal at center ice and backhand the puck into the empty net
the good
alex debrincat the kid is looking more confident with the puck and is usually in the right position at the right time while still getting pushed around a bit it seems debrincat is learning how to win his battles two points on the night
artem anisimov while not finding the score sheet anisimov proved his worth with a few good shot attempts and his line created some good chances
the penalty kill the hawks would go five for six on the pk they seem more aggressive and have better cycling better than we saw last season so far
john hayden hayden very well may play himself into a roster spot while not scoring in this game he would end up with three hits and 2 shots on net the more hayden plays the more he shows his skill speed and physicality he also seems to cause a little disruption when he is on the ice almost starting another fight in front of the goal
vinnie hinostroza while i dont know if he will make the opening night roster watching vinnie was fun tonight as we know hinostroza is fast he is really starting to show the offensive upside he is starting to make more smart plays and is also seeing the plays much better
anton forsberg forsberg would have another good night in goal saving 32 of 34 shots as of now expect forsberg to be the backup the bad power play not horrible but the hawks went one for four on the power play seeing a couple more shots and some more zone time would be nice but they were also missing some major pieces on the power play the ugly tomas jurco yet again another game where he was invisible other than occasionally touching the puck jurco had zero shots on goal one hit and a giveaway can we please get rid of this failed experiment

"__label__real budapest reuters hungary wants the european union to speed up integration of the western balkans and for nato to include those countries foreign minister peter szijjarto said on wednesday
speeding up the accession process is a guarantee of security szijjarto said at a news conference also attended by a dozen officials from central european and western balkan countries
an unstable and tensionriddled western balkans is a serious risk to all of europe
he said the eu should launch accession talks with albania and macedonia no later than the first quarter of 2018
the eu should also offer bosnia and kosovo realistic and attainable integration goals and timetables and at natos december meeting of foreign ministers the military organization should make a decision to start macedonias membership talks and activate a membership action plan for bosnia
he said one important risk of an unstable southeastern european region was its inability to withstand a new wave of migration
if a new wave of migration were to come only a stable and strong west balkans can stop that szijjarto said at the moment the eu has no strategy regarding the west balkans
other foreign ministers and diplomatic leaders echoed that sentiment
our nation is geographically surrounded by eu member states but we have been on the periphery of the political attention of the eu macedonian foreign minister nikola dimitrov said"

after two long years with the columbus blue jackets and john tortorella brandon saad is back at home with the chicago blackhawks while artemi panarin had great chemistry with patrick kane saad is arguably more valuable to the blackhawks when saad was traded away blackhawks fans and other hockey circles were quick to point out that he wouldnt be as good with columbus because he spent most of his time with toews and hossa on the first line saad answered his critics with two straight 53 point seasons even surviving tortorellas nonsensical coaching methods tortorella would bench saad or relegate him to the fourth line at times quennevilles dog house isnt even that bad saad is the complete hockey player package skates hard and fast defensively reliable finishing scoring touch and hard to knock off the puck with those tools the blackhawks needed to have saad back in the fold to reignite toews and anchor down the first line with hossa out of the lineup this year saad is one of the few players that can fill that gap im totally aware that hossa cant just be replaced saad can still provide that same stability and presence the saad toews panik line can be a force to be reckoned with this season brandon saad on marian hossas influence
 that guy hossa means a lot to a lot of people for me to come in as a young guy especially hes a guy ive looked up to i think he plays the game the way i want to play the game
stan bowman ultimately brought saad back because hes cost controlled at 6 million a year over 4 years and only 24 years old there was absolutely no way the blackhawks could afford panarins contract after 2 years when his asking price will likely be over 7 million if the past two years and this years preseason is any indication saad is ready to have the best season of his career back at home with the blackhawks and once again fans can kneel before saad

"__label__real cnn cnn asked a group of women and men actors writers and other thinkers to explore questions raised not just by the harassment allegations against harvey weinstein but by a series of recent challenges to women that have reopened discussion about sexual harassment gender and power what is the biggest impediment to equality for women and girls today and what made you realize anew that it was there
the views expressed here are solely those of the authors
piper perabo exposing the problem is a first step
i was privileged to learn orienteering as a girl scout work as an au pair in europe and take wilderness survival classes in college when i became an actress naive as it sounds i hadnt really hit an obstacle because of my gender so when the access hollywood tapes came out and i heard a presidential candidate brag about sexual assault and with a kind of easy laughter my knees went weak and my heart went out to all the young girls who heard it on the news that night and for the young women who were voting in their first presidential election
i had a similar feeling after recent news stories recounted allegations against harvey weinstein these famous incidents make the news but they are not singular this behavior of white male dominance is understood and cherished thats what i hear in the shared laughter on that access hollywood tape these conversations expose all the work we have to do just to admit where were at so we can find our way to equality and i see that as a sign of hope
piper perabo is an actress known for her role as cia agent annie walker in the tv series covert affairs for which she was earned a golden globe nomination in 2010 she has appeared in numerous films including looper the prestige imagine me and you and her breakout role in coyote ugly perabo is also a voice of advocacy for the international rescue committee
poorna jagannathan does violence against women not count
as a teenager on a new delhi bus i would invariably feel a hand down my shirt or up my skirt it was an everyday occurrence that on top of an assault at 9 just made the extraordinary event of sexual violence into the most ordinary thing i did what most of us do kept silent
poorna jagannathan
but even at 9 it was a calculated choice i chose to stay silent because it was better than telling parents and teachers and they not doingunable to do anything about it by staying silent i betrayed just myself speaking out would have led to my betrayal by the people i loved the most
then on december 16 2012 jyoti singh pandey a 23yearold medical student boarded a bus in new delhi she was gangraped beaten and tortured by six men though she lived only for a few days she found the strength to testify against her attackers to demand justice for herself the press called her nibhaya fearless one
her story inspired me and so many women across india and the world to break our silences wed had enough the dam had simply burst we began to see the violence as extraordinary again
silence is a hard thing to understand i thought it protected me but it protected my perpetrators i thought it would end the violence but it was actually what was perpetuating it i thought the silence was all mine but it was what made me deeply complicit in the culture of violence
just watched bana alabeds message on dayofthegirl replay more videos must watch bana alabeds message on dayofthegirl 0046
my silence layered on top of the silences of millions of other women created a system where there was no accountability when we broke it we were sure the system would collapse that our breaking of the silence would end the cycle of violence
but as more women dare to break their silences many times at enormous costs to themselves we are faced with an entirely new reality there is no real fallout no real consequences
although kate winslet has denounced harvey weinstein ill never forget that line from an interview she gave when roman polanski invites you to join him in any project you really dont say no because i want her i need her and everyone else to scream no because so many of us couldnt we were too young too scared too frozen does violence against women not count polanski is the film director who fled the united states to avoid prison for raping a 13yearold girl in 1977
that apology letter that harvey weinstein wrote wasnt the sound of a man oblivious to the gravity of the accusations of sexual harassment and assault that have been made against him its the sound of a man who has read so many scripts he knows the ending better than anyone else expect him to lie low for a while then emerge under a new company with a new name maybe with a phoenixrising logo and go back to business as usual
the system will support his slow integration while it will continue to betray those who have the courage to speak out
poorna jagannathan is an actress and producer best known for her portrayal of safar khan in the emmynominated show the night of in response to the 2012 gang rape and death of jyoti singh pandey she initiated and produced the play nirbhaya written and directed by yael farber
rachel sklar this is an everywhere story
the allegations against harvey weinstein are grotesque and horrifying and familiar how many women read about weinstein literally blocking a womans path and thought yep ive been there how many women remembered their own experiences pushing away unwanted embraces and uninvited hands or worse
rachel sklar
this isnt just a hollywood story this is an everywhere story its the story of men in power using and abusing it against women cajoling and taking berating and threatening trapping and menacing its the story of women being doubted and called crazy or labeled as gold diggers or attention seekers or more likely not saying anything at all because by all available metrics thats the safest easiest way to go and yes its the story of thinking that when youre a star they let you do it you can do anything
there are many things that are truly shocking about the harvey weinstein story the brazenness of the overtures the sheer number of women he allegedly harassed intimidated and forced himself upon but the mind reels at realizing just how many people had to have known something for so long assistants and producers and actors and publicists and colleagues and procurers to make things even grosser that this was such an open secret speaks to the normalization of treating women as casually disposable objects and it speaks to a culture that not only tolerates but lionizes the men who treat them that way

don mcpherson men have to break the silence
don mcpherson
i have been working to prevent mens violence against women since i retired from pro football in 1994 awareness of the problem has grown but critical underlying causes remain unchecked men are still silent
i came to realize we dont raise boys to be men we raise them not to be women in other words we dont deliberately nurture boys to be emotionally whole and nonviolent we leave them vulnerable to a broader culture dominated by patriarchy and traditions of silence from men about themselves and the sexism and misogyny that harm women
to break that silence i examined the culture in which i was nurtured this led me to a crucial question i ask all men whats the worst insult you heard as a boy the answer you throw like a girl this charge enforces a narrow view of masculinity demanding that boys man up and delivers an insidiously dangerous message that girls and women are less than
my work is focused on the deliberate and intentional engagement of boys and men not simply to prevent violence against women but to help boys and men recognize how sexism diminishes them while simultaneously supporting a culture of misogyny and silence about mens violence against women

danai gurira listen and learn what it feels like to be a girl
danai gurira
on international day of the girl it is important that we remember how much is at stake remember the girl in mali who cannot go to school but watches her brother go every day remember the girl in chad in a forced marriage the girl who has never had a chance to explore her potential before becoming a wife a mother remember the girl kidnapped from her school in 2014 in northern nigeria who was forced to become the wife of a rebel army member and is going through hell daily
and remember the women right here in the united states who have been assaulted and violated and disrespected by powerful men and silenced by corrupt systems of power and control remember that girl in every woman you encounter who deserves to discover her potential her power and how to fly
she must function in a world that too often treats her like prey clips her wings burdens her with tormented memories of fear and shame remember that girl today the same girl inside so many women full of wounds but bandaged over with silence and a smile
remember the world she is in so often hostile to her truth to the fullness and volume of her voice the world that convinces her she is always to blame take the time today not only to remember but to listen to learn to start to understand what if feels like in this world for a girl and resolve to make it better for her

erin richards we need to teach men how to communicate their feelings to women
erin richards
i was speaking to my executive producer about the stories surrounding harvey weinstein a man whose alleged despicable lechery and abuse of power was widely known among women in my line of business and we came to the conclusion that though its been too long coming these revelations are a positive step forward as media moguls like weinstein bill cosby roger ailes and others fall they send a strong message to other predators that this level of harassment will no longer be tolerated
but the bigger issue is that we dont teach men how to appropriately communicate their feelings to women we dont explain to them that being rejected does not make them less of men we need to give them the correct vocabulary to express themselves we need to help ingrain in them messages of selflove so that they dont act out their repressed frustrations on others thats how we will make a safer society for us all

reshma saujani we need to take power and make opportunity for ourselves
reshma saujani
i joined the fight to close the gender gap in tech after a political campaign where i saw coding and robotics classes full of boys i couldnt stop coming back to the faces i didnt see i kept thinking where are the girls
i started an organization to do something about that but these days you cant flip on the tv or check your news feed without hearing about horrible mistreatment of women whistleblowers from college campuses to silicon valley to hollywood have begun to bring rampant closeted sexual harassment out of the shadows yet for every brave woman who speaks out hundreds of powerful men remain silent and thus complicit
these men could turn the tide far faster than women can thats a sad but true fact and yet they dont as a result casual small acts of sexism may hang around for another whole generation
thats the bad news the good news is that as any psychologist or selfempowerment guru will tell you how we respond and act in the face of that is up to us i believe we need to stop trying to wrestle for power respect and opportunities from others and instead make them for ourselves

alice stewart this is not about politics its about an alleged sexual predator
alice stewart
when you campaign and write books claiming to be a protector of women it should take no time for you to condemn the despicable actions of movie mogul and democratic donor harvey weinstein for some reason it took former secretary of state hillary clinton and former president barack obama five days to tell the world they were disgusted by the allegations against weinstein what should have been an instant rebuke took nearly a week of public pressure to come forth
this includes clinton and obama no word on whether they will return the money though the democratic congressional campaign committee it just so happens this alleged sexual predator has been hiding in plain sight in hollywood and washington for decades and has donated millions of dollars to democratic candidates over the yearsthis includes clinton and obama no word on whether they will return the money though the democratic congressional campaign committee has said it will give its donations to womens rights organizations
at the end of the day though this is not about politics this is about a man whose behavior was demeaning and damaging to countless women isolated incidents of sexual abuse happen what we have here is a trend enabled by people looking the other way for fear of retribution
the culture of complicity cannot continue lets hear these women out lets support their courage and lets hold this man accountable for his actions

roxanne jones women who wait to report abuse and harassment arent heroes
roxanne jones
its become the vogue in hollywood for women to wait decades before speaking out about past sexual assaults or harassment theyve faced over their career by powerful men and while its nice that these women are finally telling their painful stories publicly i dont think they are heroes or even especially courageous
too harsh you say not at all for me settling for a huge financial settlement from your employer writing a book or even worse staying silent when confronted by a predator at work is the weakest move we can make as women who profess to want full equality and respect and while it may keep you safe for a moment or gainfully employed your silence puts every other woman at risk for harassment or much worse
workplace harassment isnt just a hollywood problem working women face these predators every day ive been there myself as a young woman on a fasttrack career who was harassed and groped by a bully at work many advised me to stay quiet instead that week i reported the incident not just to human resources but to the head of the company and yes i was terrified that id ruin my career i didnt as far as i know
whether its weinsteins accusers the scores of women who accused bill cosby or even top anchors such as gretchen carlson who won a 20 million suit after fox ceo roger ailes allegedly harassed her at work its hard for me to find much reason to hope that we are any closer to full equality using this passiveaggressive strategy to gain equal rights
lets stop hiding our pain in the closet hoping it will go away hoping men will accept us if we stay pretty silent and compliant each of us finding our voice is the only path to true empowerment

porochista khakpour women in america are secondclass citizens at best and this is unacceptable
porochista khakpour
im sad to say ive been aware of gender inequities since i was a young child a refugee leaving iran it was clear that with the mandatory veil the new regime in iran had decided that women were not worthy of choice one would have hoped that traveling to the west and relocating to america would have meant an end to all that but the sexism i experienced in the united states was consistent and with no end in sight in the classroom by pupils and teachers in the workplace by colleagues and bosses everywhere
ive been raped assaulted or sexually harassed so many times in my life i now think with the trump administration we are further than ever from resolving all this our greatest impediment is a president who has proudly harassed and allegedly sexually assaulted numerous women we need to set ourselves apart from this and work harder than ever to make this place safer for the generations to come women in this supposedly greatest nation in the world are currently secondclass citizens at best and we need to let it be known vocally this is unacceptable

jill filipovic how far misogyny can take you in america
jill filipovic
ive been writing about womens rights for more than a decade mostly online with the attendant verbal attacks first in blog and website comment sections and later on social media ive had stalkers and received rape and death threats there is not a day that goes by without someone berating me online not a misogynist slur i have not been called hundreds of times i thought i knew misogyny
and then the republican nominee for president was caught bragging about grabbing women by their genitals and won the election anyway
women and men need to acknowledge what this means we already knew that sexual abusers could for years operate under the radar of highprofile industries as has been alleged with harvey weinstein
but women are even further away from safety and equality than the most cynical feminists believed when an admitted sexual predator can actually win a national election
it wasnt a surprise that someone such as donald trump would yuck it up about sexual assault or that women accused him of doing what he said he did nor was it a surprise that the more craven members of the republican party would back him if it meant getting their way on racist immigration bans or tax cuts for the rich they sought but nearly all of them
and so many men most men voted for him and not as many but still so very many women typically white women typically married to men voted for him too women are nowhere near safe when so many of our family members and friends our husbands and brothers and sons support an unrepentant misogynist or conclude deep disdain for women is something that can be put aside for politics we are not equal when so many women decided the humanity of their sisters didnt matter
now the administration of an american president in 2017 is showing women what it thinks of them weakening birth control access attacking abortion rights undermining fair pay laws and more
i assumed we could mostly agree that misogyny and sexual violence were bad i assumed my online tormenters were sexist outliers it turns out we cant because they are trumps america theyve always been haranguing women on twitter i just didnt think theyd make it to the white house

aijen poo understanding where the inequity lies
aijen poo
the first step to achieving gender equity is understanding where the inequity lies discovering that requires the bravery of women to come forward with their stories in this context we assume the moment of courage is breaking the silence which requires immense courage but in reality life after the silence is broken can be the hardest part
when i was in college i worked as a hotline volunteer at a domestic violence shelter for asian immigrant women the women i spoke to were mostly mothers and a significant motivation for leaving their abusers was the safety of their children the majority of those women worked in garment factories restaurants and in homes as caregivers or house cleaners many worked long hours but it never seemed to be enough to pay the rent or put food on the table and so they often ended up back in the shelter or back with their abusers
that women suffer abuse harassment or inequity in the workplace is undeniable but the challenges faced after speaking out are so enormous that many women keep their stories silent for years and years as we read in the news or are forced back into cycles of violence as i heard on the hotline we need to ensure women are heard but also supported with economic opportunities and supportive communities afterward the only thing worse than silence is isolation and vulnerability after the silence is broken
oset babur the biggest impediment to equality is a lack of trust in women
oset babur
as someone who attended a womens college ive been asked time and time again often by men what the objective of such an institution is in the 21st century after all women can now apply to schools whose classrooms were once offlimits and find themselves at the head of boardrooms that were once inaccessible right but in this century the president of the united states brags that his star power gives him rights to womens bodies as a trusty tool in committing sexual assault and in this century our first instinct is to subject repeatedly every decision women make whether it be about their reproductive health or speaking up against abuse to an intense level of scrutiny that could do wonders if it were put to use in say antigun legislation universal health care or education
the biggest impediment to gender equality i see in 2017 is a universal lack of trust toward women this distrust is reinforced every single time a senior executive repurposes a female colleagues ideas as his own and every time someone without the ability to become pregnant makes a decision on behalf of those who can and while its true that trust is usually earned it just isnt up to women anymore to earn this trust its up to everyone else from harvey weinstein to donald trump to show that they are deserving of it

peggy drexler women arent turning out for feminism
peggy drexler
its commendable of course that after the raft of horrendous sexual harassment allegations against harvey weinstein and other major power brokers in the media more and more women are speaking out against the men who abuse positions of power at their expense or against the industries that compensate men at a higher level than women but the root of the problem lies much deeper
when hillary clinton lost a presidency to a white man far less qualified far less prepared and far more volatile it became clear that women were perhaps just as culpable as men in the fight against systemic inequality and not just the 53 of white women who voted for donald trump many who did so because they were uncomfortable voting for a woman or could not get past the sexist stereotypes that were continually hung around this woman but also the many millennial women who too resisted clinton because of her gender
these are women who arent turning out for feminism or who dont take it seriously who view the fight as outdated because they never had to fight it themselves or so they think because the fight is far from over the allegations against weinstein are only the latest expression of this my greatest hope is that those who have the power and need to stand up for women will realize its not only entirely relevant but essential that they do so my greatest fear however is that they will not

naaz modan being judged by what you wear
naaz modan
shortly after i decided to wear the hijab i noticed a shift in how i was perceived in public and professional settings my contribution to academic discussions as a college student was received with surprise at my intelligence and now my work as journalist is oftentimes taken with a grain or mountain of salt by readers comments ive received range from the author of this wears a scarf to we dont need to hear about americas problems from you in a hijab my perceived intellect and the amount of influence i command in a room are dictated in others minds by the clothes i wear
there is a similar struggle on the opposite end of the spectrum where a womans value and experiences in the workplace are determined by the amount of skin she chooses to show and how she chooses to show it
on one end if she shows too little or chooses to cover with a scarf she is considered sexually oppressed and intellectually stunted whereas if she shows too much she is reducing herself to her sexuality and ultimately asking to be assaulted nowhere is this clearer than in the most recent case of harvey weinstein where the women who came forward were criticized for how they presented themselves
this kind of genderbased power dynamic permeates every womans experience to some extent whether she is fully covered or not sometimes even before she enters the workplace

jeff yang
i feel like there wasnt any singular moment when the degree of work needed was suddenly made plain its always been there but always suppressed overlooked and dismissed i think that the reporting around sexual harassment in silicon valley in which a disproportionate number of the victims stepping forward were asianamerican women in particular hammered home to me that there are layered aspects to whos targeted how they respond whose stories are believed women of color are most frequently ignored and asianamerican women frequently subjected to stereotypical expectations of silence and passivity
that intersectional context is too often set to the side in these debates and it shouldnt be

"__label__real rome reuters italy has had five outbreaks of highly pathogenic h5n8 avian flu in farms the central and northern parts of the country since the start of the month and about 880000 chickens ducks and turkeys will be culled officials said on wednesday
the biggest outbreak of the h5n8 virus which led to the death or killing of millions of birds in an outbreak in western europe last winter was at a large egg producing farm in the province of ferrara
the latest outbreak was confirmed on oct 6 and about 853000 hens are due to be culled by oct 17 the izsv zoological institute said

"__label__real a year after losing a threegamestoone lead to the chicago cubs in the world series the indians lost three straight to the yankees and just like last season the final defeat came at their own ballpark
the yankees now head to houston where they will begin the american league championship series on friday against a familiar nemesis the astros lefthander dallas keuchel who helped eliminate them in the 2015 wildcard playoff
the yankees though are unlikely to be cowed after having rallied to knock off the indians who had roared their way to an american leagueleading 102 victories and had lost only four times between aug 23 and the end of the regular season
any time youre down 20 and particularly the way it happened it was a tough loss it shows a lot about them hal steinbrenner the yankees principal owner said as he stood outside the jubilant clubhouse theyve been loose the entire time just lighthearted the entire time had their backs the entire time
photo
the yankees staved off elimination first with a 10 win in game 3 on sunday behind masahiro tanakas dominant performance and greg birds solo homer then they evened the series monday night with a 73 victory in game 4
the yankees got an auspicious start on wednesday from gregorius who had an uneasy transition to the bronx when he replaced derek jeter two years ago he hit both home runs in the first three innings off the indians ace corey kluber gregorius had entered wednesday with two career hits in 15 atbats off kluber
gregorius speaks four languages fluently dutch spanish papiamento the tongue of his native curaçao and english but as home runs have flown off his bat and he settled into the middle of the yankees lineup this season his answer to whether he considered himself a home run hitter was easy to understand in any language no

if i hit a home run i hit a home run gregorius said im not going out to try to hit home runs every time
if the regular season when he hit 25 home runs breaking jeters record for a yankees shortstop was not enough to prompt a reconsideration these playoffs have been gregorius also blasted a momentumswinging home run against the minnesota twins in the yankees 84 wildcard victory before adding two more on wednesday night
i think back to a couple of years ago when we first got him and everybody in the stands every night was chanting derek jeters name gardner said nowadays you dont hear that

gregoriuss first home run on a 12 fastball stunned the capacity crowd at progressive field and put the yankees ahead by 10 in the first inning the second came in the third on a 11 curveball and pushed the yankees advantage to 30
i was on base for the second one and it was a nodoubter but i told him i went back to tag up because i figured theres no way he could take him deep twice in the same game gardner said
that was all the offense the yankees would need and all they would get until the ninth with his team clinging to a 32 lead gardner hit a twoout single to right field on the 12th pitch of his atbat against closer cody allen aaron hicks raced home from second and when right fielder jay bruces throw bounced away from shortstop francisco lindor an alert todd frazier dashed home
that sealed a comeback that was made possible by the yankees pitching staff which yielded five runs over the final three games and they mustered enough offense to overcome a grim series from aaron judge who struck out four times on wednesday and finished the series 1 for 20 with 16 strikeouts shattering the record for a playoff series of 13 that had been held by four other players ryan howard jackson brandon moss and javier baez

the yankees scant offense stood up on wednesday because of a calm start from c c sabathia and a finishing kick from robertson and chapman who covered the final two innings robertson who threw a careerhigh 52 pitches in the wildcard game eight days earlier had not looked the same since surrendering the gametying home run to bruce in game 2
but girardi called on him after the indians strung together four consecutive oneout singles from jackson bruce roberto perez and giovanny urshela to narrow the yankees lead to 32 in the fifth it would turn out to be the games crucial moment
advertisement continue reading the main story
with runners at first and second lindor who had a woeful series other than his tideturning grand slam in game 2 hit an 01 cutter back up the middle robertson reached for it but pulled his glove away at the last instant which proved to be a wise decision
you see a ball coming back at you your first response is to protect yourself whether its hit hard or not robertson said
the ball bounced right to gregorius who was stationed almost directly behind second base he stepped on the bag and threw to first for a double play that ended the threat
it was another moment in this series where the margin of victory was pinstripe thin if judge were 6 feet tall instead of 6foot7 he might not have been able to leap at the wall to steal what looked to be a tworun homer from lindor in the yankees 10 win in game 3 and the yankees took the lead in game 4 when fraziers line drive landed precisely on the line opening a fourrun inning
but even being in this series felt unlikely when the yankees arrived in tampa for spring training they hoped a night like wednesday was possible but few believed it would come this season
the unloading of many of the yankees veterans last year like alex rodriguez mark teixeira carlos beltran and brian mccann created a great deal of enthusiasm around their raft of young talent but it was also accompanied by plenty of questions two young players who emerged as stars this season judge and pitcher luis severino did not solidify their roster spots until the week before opening day
but the yankees coalesced quickly they posted the best exhibition record in baseball and carried that into the regular season leaping to a 219 start through early may the next several months carried with it some travails injuries judges secondhalf funk and chapmans temporary demotion among them but the yankees chased the boston red sox for the american league east title until the penultimate day of the season
as it turned out it was not a pyrrhic chase the fight the yankees showed seemed to help forge a resolve one they counted on in recent days to cover the distance from devastation to elation"

moscow reuters software produced by microsoft corp has been acquired by state organizations and firms in russia and crimea despite sanctions barring usbased companies from doing business with them official documents show
the acquisitions registered on the russian state procurement database show the limitations in the way foreign governments and firms enforce the us sanctions imposed on russia over its annexation of the crimea peninsula from ukraine in 2014
some of the users gave microsoft fictitious data about their identity people involved in the transactions told reuters exploiting a gap in the us companys ability to keep its products out of their hands
the products in each case were sold via third parties and reuters has no evidence that microsoft sold products directly to entities hit by the sanctions
microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and we have been looking into this matter in recent weeks a microsoft representative said in an emailed response to questions from reuters
we have robust trade compliance processes around the world to help ensure that our partners comply with all conditions including immediate halting of suspected improper sales by partners and strong measures to try to prevent banned customers from accessing and using our products and services
all state organizations and state firms are obliged to disclose purchases they make on the procurement database people involved in five of the transactions confirmed to reuters the software had been acquired
the reuters review of the database found state entities in russia and crimea that are subject to sanctions have acquired more than 5000 microsoft products worth about 60 million rubles 103 million
the sum is relatively small but such software is vital for many firms and organizations in russia and crimea to operate the database also does not include private companies so the scale of the problem could be much bigger
related coverage factbox entities subject to sanctions that bought microsoft products
among entities hit by sanctions that acquired microsoft products was almazantey manufacturer of the buk surfacetoair missile dutch prosecutors say a buk missile brought down a malaysian airlines passenger jet over east ukraine in july 2014 though russia denies its forces shot down the plane
other microsoft buyers the database shows include glavgosexpertiza a state design agency involved in work on a new bridge from russia to crimea and the krym health spa in crimea owned by russias defense ministry
the arms manufacturer almazantey did not respond to a request for comment the defense ministrys health spa in crimea declined to comment glavgosexpertiza said the company operates within the russian legal framework
compliance crackdown

one set of us sanctions prohibits the export by a us entity of any goods services or technology to crimea
other sanctions bar us firms from carrying out transactions with companies or individuals on a list of specially designated nationals deemed by washington to be linked to the russian government and its activities in ukraine
microsoft did not directly respond to detailed questions about specific users of its products and the compliance procedures it has in place
the products acquired by organizations hit by sanctions include open license program services where the user must provide microsoft with the companys full name and address
almazantey glavgosexpertiza and the defense ministry spa acquired open license program products the database showed
slideshow 4 images
after the sanctions were introduced microsoft took steps to prevent entities hit by sanctions acquiring its products according to five sources involved in the software reselling trade and a former microsoft employee in russia
but people involved in transactions say ways can be found to circumvent obstacles
the morye shipyard based in crimea bought 150 windows server sql server and office licenses in june 2016 from ooo webpotok a firm registered in moscow the procurement database shows all the products were open license program services
the shipyard fell under the general prohibition on transactions by us firms with entities in crimea and is now on the special designated nationals list
if we bought directly from microsoft there would be sanctions a shipyard employee speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue said by telephone but there were no problems with buying thirdparty from russian firms
the shipyard declined to comment reuters called telephone numbers listed for the supplier ooo webpotok but the people who answered said they worked for a different company
another way to circumvent the restrictions on crimeabased entities is for the user when registering the product with microsoft not to provide a crimean address three people involved in the trade said
they said addresses in russias krasnodar region across the kerch strait from crimea were commonly used instead
a supplier who worked with a company on the us specially designated nationals list said a supplier and a client could circumvent restrictions by registering microsoft products to a subsidiary or parent company of the end user"

"__label__real the actress rose mcgowan who was one of the first to speak out about harvey weinsteins alleged sexual assaults was temporarily limited from using some twitter features
twitter locked her account for 12 hours for violating its rules
the social media company has since said it was because one of her tweets included a private phone number
mcgowan was named in a new york times article revealing decades of sexual harassment against young actresses
the limit meant she couldnt tweet retweet or like posts and could only send direct messages but twitter said her account has now been unlocked and the relevant tweet was deleted
in their message to mcgowan twitter said it would reactivate her account if she deleted tweets which violate their rules
twitter has now confirmed that publishing a private phone number was a breach
previously people thought her suspension may have been over tweets she posted about actor ben affleck
in a tweet which has since been deleted she said that affleck knew about weinsteins behaviour
affleck posted a facebook status saying that he was saddened and angry at weinstein who used his position of power to intimidate sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades
in another tweet she swears at ben affleck
according to the twitter rules harassment and hateful conduct are grounds for being suspended
weinstein is accused of using his power and influence to take advantage of and sexually harass young actresses in hollywood over the course of three decades
a number of hollywood stars have spoken out against the behaviour as more victims including cara delevingne and angelina jolie have come forward
weinstein denies the accusations and says he is seeing therapists about his misconduct he has been fired from the company he cofounded

i have an original voice says belinda carlisle
it may not be the best voice but its distinct and i think thats what has carried me through the years
shes being modest of course without that foundationquaking vibrato there would be no heaven is a place on earth no circle in the sand and no summer rain
and then theres her catalogue with the gogos the new wave girl band she formed in her teens hits like we got the beat and our lips are sealed sent their debut album to number one in america
to this day beauty and the beat is still the only us charttopper to be written and played by women
but through all of that success carlisle was harbouring a severe cocaine habit even fellow party animal rod stewart was shocked writing in his autobiography that carlisle could snort the lacquer off a table
after two decades though the singer finally got clean after hearing a voice telling her you are going to be found dead in a hotel if you dont stop
that was in 2005 now aged 59 shes releasing her first album in a decade wilder shores which is built around the kundalini yoga chants that helped her recovery
on the phone from brighton she told the bbc about that record the 30th anniversary of the heaven on earth album and what its like to be covered in spit at a punk show
image copyright lisa borgnes giamonti image caption carlisle now lives in france and practises yoga every day
hi belinda hows brighton
i love brighton ive been coming here since the late 70s when it was just one fishandchip shop on the sea front
that would have been when the gogos supported madness on tour
yes exactly it was my second trip to the uk i think i was probably 19 and we opened for madness on their tour and it was mostly seaside towns
what were the audiences like at those gigs
oh my god back then the whole national front thing was unfortunately involved with the ska movement so there were lots of tattooed skinheads and one of the things they would do is if they liked you they would gob on you so we would be coming off stage covered in spit
we were just five girls from southern california so it was really scary there were a lot of tears but overall even though we had no money and were covered in spit we still had a good time
image copyright rex shutterstock image caption the gogos in 1983 charlotte caffey belinda carlisle gina schock kathy valentine jane wiedlin
im always amazed that the gogos are still the only allfemale band to have written a number one album its like you battered down the door and noone else came through
i dont know i guess the bangles came close
but they used a lot of cowriters
yeah they did go figure youd think there would be more after us but there werent i dont understand that at all
you can still see your legacy in other bands like haim or hole or l7 its just a shame noone else has replicated the success
well i mean good luck now unless youre put together by a svengali something like the gogos could never happen now it was too authentic and authenticity is really lacking in music
image copyright itv rex shutterstock image caption the star scored five top 10 albums in the uk between 1987 and 1993
was there a backlash when you went from punkinspired sound of the gogos to the pure pop of heaven on earth
oh i think so and i can see why but everything ive ever done has been true to myself the albums heaven on earth and runaway horses and live your life be free were harking back to when i was a young girl and listening to californian radio lush productions complicated melodies harmonies like the beach boys and the mamas and papas thats what those albums remind me of
so theyre all very dear to my heart except a woman and a man belindas sixth album released in 1996
but even on that record you got to work with brian wilson
well gosh that was one of the highlights but you know at that point i was in a lot of personal turmoil i guess there were a few good songs in there and california was one of them having brian wilson sing on my album was an unforgettable experience
what do you recall of making the heaven on earth album
ill never forget the first time i heard circle in the sand or i get weak which songwriter dianne warren played on the piano and sang for me i actually told her she should release it because she has a great voice and then hearing heaven for the first time i realised and i think we all realised that it had the potential to be a global hit
which songs have you enjoyed revisiting on the tour
should i let you in id totally forgotten about that one and fool for love which i started working into my set this last summer people love it its just such a fun powerful pop song
image copyright virgin image caption heaven on earth produced five hit singles in the uk
you dont have any writing credits on heaven on earth but by your fifth album real you were contributing to almost every song what changed
for the first three albums pretty much i was just a voice and i mean that in the best possible way but on real i felt i needed to make a change
ive always known i could write i have an ear for production and melody it was just that in those early years i let everyone do it for me to be honest i was a little lazy
listening to real now it was ahead of its time insofar as its sound and incorporating loops and right after that alanis morrisette came out with jagged little pill which had a similar approach i mean im not claiming that theres not an original thought out there it just happened to be a little ahead of its time
fastforward to 2017 and youve just performed a concert at a yoga class
that was really good fun the yoga audience was pretty new for me but what was funny was seeing fans whod never done yoga before coming in with their mats and experiencing the mantra and singing along with it
how did you end up making an album of chants
i started chanting before i got sober and chanting is really interesting because its a science and it definitely works
way back at the beginning i had made so many messes in my life and it had all come to a head it would have been very easy for me to jump off a cliff but because of all the chanting i was doing i was flying high it was like a feeling of elation at the very beginning of my sobriety it was very strange so i know its power
then i started experimenting with repetitive mantra in a pop song format and i think it works and thats how you get wilder shores
image copyright getty images image caption the gogos have reformed several times and performed at the 2016 billboard music awards
which of the mantras on the album has been the most useful to you personally
ek ong kar sat gur prasad roughly translated as there is one creator of all creation all is a blessing of the one creator its one that simply put makes me feel pretty happy instantaneously
could you have got sober without it
oh i probably could have but theres no question that it made my transition into sobriety easier no question
will you be singing the mantras on tour
i do one chant at the very very end of the show but it doesnt really work in the context of a fullon rock concert the focus is really on the heaven on earth album
your voice sounds stronger than ever on the record what do you put that down to
well i always say it was 30 years of booze and cigarettes

"__label__fake the sweet season in coming up but with good habits and careful monitoring teeth problems can be avoided according to gilroy dentist
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
candy is harder to avoid on halloween than pumpkin spice and spooky ghosts and witches but according to gilroy dentist dr jernell escobar teeth problems can be avoided with some good habits and monitoring the amount of candy children eat
gilroy ca sept 28 2017 candy is harder to avoid on halloween than pumpkin spice and spooky ghosts and witches but according to gilroy dentist dr jernell escobar teeth problems can be avoided with some good habits and monitoring the amount of candy children eat
it really can be quite a challenge for parents to let children enjoy halloween but still maintain the health of their teeth says dr escobar but the solution isnt to ban all candy which is an impossible but to closely monitor their intake of candies and other sweets
halloween is the start of the sweet season which includes thanksgiving christmas and new years eve the time of the year that is taken up with holiday parties family celebrations school activities and community events parents have to be extra attentive during this time of the year because many of these events feature cookies cakes pies brownies and other sweet treats
dr escobar wants people to be aware that there are good sweets and bad sweets much as there are good habits and bad habits when it comes to the health of their teeth
sweets such as taffy and hard candies that can sit on or stuck between teeth for long periods of time actually increases the risk of tooth decay bacteria feeds on the sugar on the teeth producing acid that causes tooth decay
candies such as sugarfree gum can prevent cavities by dislodging food particles and increasing saliva which helps to neutralize acids in the mouth and prevent tooth decay
we cant avoid all sweets of course but by being smart with our choices going for healthy alternatives and promoting a healthy oral routine with our kids we can all keep our families happy and healthy during the holiday season says dr escobar
the american dental association on its website mouthhealthyorg offers 10 easytofollow tips to help your children maintain a healthy mouth and teeth
1 eat halloween candy and other sugary foods with meals or shortly after mealtime saliva production increases during meals and helps cancel out acids produced by bacteria in your mouth and helps rinse away food particles
2 avoid hard candy and other sweets that stay in your mouth for a long time besides how often you snack the length of time sugary food is in your mouth plays a role in tooth decay unless it is a sugarfree product candies that stay in the mouth for a long period of time subject teeth to an increased risk for tooth decay
3 avoid sticky candies that cling to your teeth the stickier candies like taffy and gummy bears take longer to get washed away by saliva increasing the risk for tooth decay
4 drink more water drinking optimally fluoridated water can help prevent tooth decay if you choose bottled water look for kinds that are fluoridated
5 maintain a healthy diet your body is like a complex machine the foods you choose as fuel and how often you fill up affect your general health and that of your teeth and gums
6 avoid beverages with added sugar such as soda sports drinks or flavored waters when teeth come in frequent contact with beverages that contain sugar the risk of tooth decay is increased
7 chew sugarless gum chewing sugarless gum for 20 minutes after meals helps reduce tooth decay because increased saliva flow helps wash out food and neutralize the acid produced by dental plaque bacteria
8 brush your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste replace your toothbrush every three or four months or sooner if the bristles are frayed a worn toothbrush wont do a good job of cleaning your teeth
9 clean between teeth daily with floss decaycausing bacteria get between teeth where toothbrush bristles cant reach flossing helps remove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and under the gum line
10 visit your dentist regular visits to your dentist can help prevent problems from occurring and catch those that do occur early when they are easy to treat

"__label__real president trump made a number of claims about the economy in his first answer on sean hannitys programme on fox news on wednesday
this is what he said
the country we took it over it owed 20 trillion as you know the last eight years they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country so they borrowed more than 10tn right and yet we picked up 52tn just in the stock market possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months in terms of value so you could say in one sense were really increasing values and maybe in a sense were reducing debt
lets go through that one claim at a time
the treasury handily gives daily updates on the level of debt which is the total amount owed by the us government
on 20 january 2017 the date of the presidents inauguration the total outstanding public debt was 1995tn 152tn
so hes right on that one
nearly right
on 20 january 2009 when president obama was sworn in the debt was 1063tn the difference is 932tn which is not more than 10tn but is still a lot of borrowing
comparing figures with the amount of debt borrowed in the whole history of the country is a bit tricky
we have to assume he means since 1789 because thats when the us treasurys records go back to
clearly there are problems with this comparison because the economy in the late 18th century is in no sense comparable with the one today
if we take the outstanding debt on inauguration day in 2009 as the total amount borrowed since 1789 then president obama did not borrow more than that he borrowed 131tn less than that
of course that net debt figure is not the total amount borrowed the total amount borrowed will be considerably more than that because some debt will have been repaid over the last few hundred years
and if its not quite true in cash terms over that period then it will certainly not be true using any measure that takes into account the growth of the economy
bloombergs us exchange market capitalisation measuring the value of all listed companies puts the current value at 2839tn while the value the day after the inauguration was 2555tn so thats an increase of 284tn
but we know from president trumps twitter account that he was actually comparing with the level on election day
skip twitter post by realdonaldtrump stock market has increased by 52 trillion dollars since the election on november 8th a 25 increase lowest unemployment in 16 years and donald j trump realdonaldtrump october 11 2017 report
on 8 november the market capitalisation was 2389tn so it has grown by 45tn
thats not quite 52tn but its still growth of about 19 which is pretty hefty
this bit is harder to interpret but it sounds like he is comparing the us debt with the value of the shares on the us stock exchange
market capitalisation is not the governments money it is shareholders money
it might lead to more taxes being paid eventually but the two figures do not belong in the same category
remember on inauguration day the debt was 1995tn
well the treasurys latest figure for 10 october was 2038tn so thats gone up by 430bn
debt did actually fall in the early months of the presidency but it jumped on 8 september when the president signed a bill raising the debt ceiling

my project tries to capture images that invoke the heritage of the sport the sort of images that make you think of the early 1920s and even the 50s and 60s when it was all black and white
recreating the past

youd be hardpushed to find a greater contrast between a camera and its subject
before making the transition to f1 paul used his 104yearold device to shoot firefighters coming out of the rubble of ground zero for the new york times in the aftermath of 911
now he spends his day capturing the worlds fastest drivers following the likes of lewis hamilton around the world
i was inspired to pick up the camera again ahead of the 2014 monaco grand prix paul explains singling out the street circuit as his favorite race on the calendar for its accessibility and atmosphere
most of the images i got from that shoot were blurry out of focus and didnt quite work
i think ive taken the camera to maybe 3040 races around the world in the last four years and now its coming together
im really used to it im anticipating the focus and its more like an extension of my body
nobody captures formula one races quite like american photographer joshua paul
the photographer has to be proactive anticipating a situation before it has occurred
while he accepts it can be frustrating to forgo many of the shots a modern day camera could obtain hes gradually catching the eye of f1s leading stars
paul regularly gives out prints of his favorite images to the drivers mechanics and team principals he depicts something he says other photographers simply dont have time for
a lot of the guys are like nobodys ever given me anything before he laughs i just say thanks for letting me walk into your garages and pit lanes
i try to let the drivers know im trying to do something different and often theyll indicate they like what im doing paul adds it could just be a nod or gesture but it means a lot to me
it takes years for a team to say yes to a portrait so i just thought lets take beautiful pictures that might appeal to someone thats not necessarily a racing fan but who might then take an interest and see f1 through childhood eyes
f1 cars to cameras
having grown up fixated by the magic of f1 the photographer will never forget the moment he first felt truly embraced by the sport
the camera broke in 2015 during my second season when i was in budapest paul recalls one of the lotus mechanics asked to see the camera and i said sorry its broken
he said oh bring it in well fix it
the lotus mechanics took the camera apart and we found all sorts of different pieces tapes and screws and we basically rebuilt the camera
in the meantime pastor maldonado had crashed his car in one of the prepractice sessions so it came in damaged and basically had to be completely rebuilt for the next morning session
but for about 30 minutes the lotus guys and i hung out and talked about the shutter curtain and what its made of what the best tape it would be for it and then he took some out
its been working ever since
romanticizing the sport
midway through pauls fourth season in f1 his project is gathering pace
the photographer now produces an expansive awardwinning magazine called lollipop that takes a behindthescenes look at whos who in f1
for him its all about romanticizing the sport making it more about the people than just the cars and the racing
some people dont get what im doing he says but its not about perfection its about what might make you smile

in fact the phrase climate change does not appear in the agencys draft fouryear strategic plan a 38page document quietly released for public comment last week
the three priorities outlined in the plan are consistent with epa administrator scott pruitts public comments about how he plans to run the agency focus on the core mission of clean air land and water rebalance the federal role in environmental regulation shifting more of the responsibility to states and enforce laws as congress intended
what doesnt appear in the agencys strategic plan for 2018 through 2022 is any mention of the words climate change or the causes behind it including carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions

"__label__fake ravens problems start at the top
before its news
after yesterdays loss which included the second straight week of a nonexistent offense some fans are clamoring for the ouster of marty mornhinweg the ravens rank last in passing yards per game averaging 1425 through four games thats 29 yards behind the second worst team the buffalo bills they also rank last in passing yards per play
dean pees hasnt been much better after two weeks the ravens were drawing comparisons to their historic 2000 defense after four weeks the ravens ranks 21st overall in total defense they let a jaguars team that lost to the jets yesterday hang 44 points on them on an international stage last week the jets have been pegged as one of the worst teams in football by the way
so here we go again fire pees and fire whoever happens to be calling plays at the moment right its a valid point but the bigger question is why are they both even still here to begin with
after last season most fans and media assumed john harbaugh would make some changes at the very least on offense after morhinweg took over for marc trestman in the middle of last year the offense didnt improve at the time morhinweg was viewed as a stopgap solution until 2017 when harbaugh would find the right play caller who could get more out of joe flacco
instead he stuck with the same crew he brought back his old buddy marty and somehow we should be surprised that were seeing a similar result a lethargic and stale offense that resembles play calls youd see at calvert hall not the nfl
so if pees needs to go and marty needs to go than harbaugh needs to go as well it was ultimately his decision to keep them both around so he should be held accountable when they predictably produce the exact same result the panic button shouldnt be pressed because the ravens have lost two straight games it should be pressed because of how theyve lost them they were embarrassed by a perennial loser that lost to the jets yesterday and then embarrassed at home against their biggest rival with first place on the line
now i know what some will say the ravens are decimated with injuries and its not harbaughs fault but the problems on offense go deeper than the rash of banged up players the play calls are predictable the team looks slow and lethargic and flacco continues to regress
some will say you cant blame the coaches and at some point it comes down to players executing the plays if thats your logic than what do we even have coaches for its their job to get the most they can out of players and this staff isnt accomplishing that
how many years in a row can excuses be made for subpar seasons if its not the injuries then its flaccos rust after recovering from knee surgery if its not flaccos knee its a lack of playmakers if its not the playmakers its playing abroad
tony lombardi has floated a theory out there before that harbaugh hires older coaches past their prime who wont threaten his job security hes stayed away from the kyle shanahans and adam gases of the world its an idea that looks more and more valid with each passing season
as long as its allowed to continue expect more of the same from this team
a lot of excuses and more embarrassing losses like weve witnessed the last two weeks

"__label__real michael bradley who played for aston villa for a short time in 2011 captained the united states in defeat
the united states failure to make russia 2018 marks a sad and dark moment for football in the country says former defender alexi lalas
tuesdays 21 defeat by trinidad and tobago means the us will miss the finals for the first time since 1986
it is not a good look or feeling it will have repercussions lalas 47 told bbc world service
they let themselves down they let us down and they will have to think about that for a very long time
the united states needed only a point in their final world cup qualifying match to book their place at an eighth successive world cup
but opponents trinidad and tobago who had won only one of their previous nine games beat them with panama and honduras also winning to end the hopes of bruce arenas side
head coach arena took responsibility for the defeat but said that theres nothing wrong with what were doing
to make any kind of crazy changes i think would be foolish were building a good system in our professional league we have players playing abroad of some quality he added
yahoo columnist leander schaerlaecken received comprehensive suggestions from his readership about ways to improve the national team
however donna e shalala one of 17 directors of governing body us soccer has called the failure unacceptable and said it is time for a revolution
lalas who scored nine goals in 96 games for his country including one in june 1993s shock 20 friendly win over england says that the united states can emerge stronger for the defeat
whether it is overconfidence or hubris this is a team that did not play as a team enough at times they showed sparks but the faltered too often and did not gain any sustained momentum he added
the united states soccer community will be shaken to its foundations this will have repercussions on the field and off the field
lalas goal capped the united states famous 1993 win over an england side that failed to qualify for the world cup in america the following year
but we will take our lumps learn dust ourselves off and come back strong having learned painful but hopefully valuable lessons in who we are and who we arent"

by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
we all want to ignore the kicker i mean really we all dont want to be bothered do we however as is the case with defenses every point matters and it would be a shame if your week went bad because of decision you chose to ignore lets take a look at how things stand for the coming week
matt bryant atlanta falcons vs buffalo giorgio tavecchio oakland raiders at denver ryan succop tennessee titans at houston graham gano carolina panthers at new england matt prater detroit lions at minnesota stephen gostkowski new england patriots vs carolina will lutz new orleans saints at miami greg zuerlein los angeles rams at dallas dan bailey dallas cowboys vs los angeles rams jason myers jacksonville jaguars at new york jets jake elliot philadelphia eagles at los angeles chargers brandon mcmanus denver broncos vs oakland nick folk tampa bay buccaneers vs new york giants blair walsh seattle seahawks vs indianapolis cody parkey miami dolphins vs new orleans
thoughts
stephen gostkowski is generally viewed as one of the elite kickers in the game and its fair the problem is that new england isnt settling for field goals thus far as hes gone just 5for5 over the first three weeks is there any reason to think thats suddenly going to change hes still worth using but he doesnt necessarily have the upside of others who play for less dynamic offenses
the denver broncos are one of two teams to allow three field goals of at least 50 yards this season while giorgio tavecchio hasnt had many opportunities over the past two weeks he has the leg strength is perfect thus far and will be kicking in the denver thin air thats a nice combination
obviously after kicking a 61yarder to win the game the eagles jake elliot is going to garner a lot of attention he has missed a kick in each of the past two weeks though hes getting opportunities 4for6 on field goals and they are all coming from a solid distance hes hit two from 4049 yards he should be considered a solid lowend option thanks to the inaccuracy and not a must use

"__label__real as of today 36000 eligible unauthorized immigrants had yet to renew their immigration status as a part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca program despite todays oct 5 deadline to renew
of the 154200 individuals whose daca status is set to expire between sept 5 2017 and march 5 2018 approximately 118000 either have renewal requests currently pending with the federal immigration agency or have already had their renewal requests adjudicated according to us citizenship and immigration services uscis which manages the program thats overseen by the department of homeland security dhs
todays deadline is part of what dhs is calling an orderly wind down of the program which the trump administration announced it was rescinding at the beginning of september the program will continue to phase out over the next five months leaving the fate of dreamers in the hands of congress
no new applications were accepted after the announcement on sept 5 and renewals would only be accepted until oct 5 for certain categories of recipients if legislative action is not taken daca recipients could begin to lose benefits on march 6 2018
eligible daca recipients have until today to properly file their renewal request and associated application for employment authorization to us citizenship and immigration services uscis dhs said in a press release tuesday
three uscis facilities are prepared to accept courier daca deliveries until midnight local time a spokesperson for the agency said thursday however uscis lockbox facilities do not accept walkups so daca renewal packages cannot be hand delivered today
for individuals who are still eligible to request renewal of their deferred action under daca but have not yet done so i urge you to make this a priority said acting dhs secretary elaine duke in a statement earlier this week
given the time needed to process the renewal requests uscis will not have a final tally of all daca renewals for at least a week according to the agency
the daca program was started by president barack obama in 2012 through an executive action that allowed certain undocumented immigrants who were children when they were brought to the us to remain in the country and be eligible for work permits if they meet certain requirements
as a candidate donald trump vowed to terminate the program calling obamas action illegal but tempered his tone once elected
to have a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest we cannot admit everyone who would like to come here its just that simple attorney general jeff sessions said announcing the administrations decision last month
since the start of the program nearly 800000 unauthorized immigrants who came to the united states as children have been granted protection from deportation under daca at the time of the announcement to end the program there were 689821 daca enrollees which excludes terminations failures to renew and those who updated their immigration status
the end of the program has angered immigration advocates spurred calls for a legislative fix and frightened recipients who will face potential deportation once their status expires
karla aguirre 22 considers herself lucky her status was set to expire at the end of january so she was able to renew for another two years giving her extended protection as the program begins to phase out
im able to renew mine but sadly there are many applicants that are not able to renew said aguirre
aguirre who has called south carolina her home since she was six years old and came to the us with her sister was able to attend high school however she struggled to pay for college because she was unable to apply for federal loans and south carolina does not offer instate tuition to undocumented students said aguirre
daca benefits allowed her to work at her sisters small business and help her parents
she said she felt desperate after trump announced the end to the program she said a facebook post calling on daca students to come to washington felt like a message from god
you want to help your community and this is how you do it she said
as of sept 4 2017 there were approximately 207000 individuals whose daca status expires between march 6 2018 and december 31 2018 this is the first group of people who could begin to lose their status
on tuesday dhs announced that uscis will accept renewal applications for people from the us virgin islands and puerto rico after oct 5th on a casebycase basis recognizing that only about five percent of the island has power
however as of tuesday fewer than 20 current recipients from the us virgin islands and puerto rico have yet to renew with uscis said dhs
no other exceptions have been made by the department
aguirre and many others have come to washington dc this week to advocate on capitol hill for legislation that would create a lasting solution for dreamers
in an effort to provide a legislative fix sens lindsey graham rsc and dick durbin dill introduced the dream act of 2017 which was modeled on earlier proposals and would allow dreamers to obtain permanent residency and american citizenship if they graduate from high school or obtain a ged and work for at least three years serve in the military or pursue higher education the bipartisan bill would require applicants to demonstrate english proficiency have no history of serious crimes and pass law enforcement and security background checks
the march 5 deadline is going to make us act failure is not an option ive never seen more bipartisan support for the idea than right this moment said graham at a press conference on wednesday
a similar bill passed the democraticcontrolled house in 2010 but failed to advance in the senate
at the end of september two republican senators introduced another bill known as the succeed act that addresses the status of the hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants this bill potentially offers dreamers a 15year path to citizenship and would also prevent recipients from sponsoring family members an attempt to address concerns from immigration hawks and trump
many immigrant advocacy groups oppose this bill and are calling for the passage of a clean bill that does not add additional border security and enforcement measures
i think it was grossly irresponsible to end daca with no contingency plan in place said patrice lawrence the national policy and advocacy coordinator for the undocublack network an network of current and formerly undocumented black people
undocublack was one of the many organizations that held clinics across the country ahead of thursdays deadline to help provide legal and financial support to daca recipients that needed to renew
we wanted to push to say dont let money be the reason you dont do it she said
the federal government did not directly inform daca recipients about the changes duke said during congressional testimony last week and uscis confirmed this week rather the agency used the press and social media to get its message out
we have not contacted each individual directly said duke during the sept 27 hearing
the deadline to renew was arbitrary and short said karla molinar a student of international studies and political science daca was one of the few bandaids that we had to protect people she added
molinar a communications fellow for the new mexico dream team the largest youthled undocumented organization in the state was brought to the us when she was 13 years old but missed the cutoff for deferred action benefits under obama by just one month
she said that the people that need to renew the most were the least likely to renew because those that werent able to get their applications in on time are likely to have less access to information and financial resources she said it was especially difficult for people impacted by the hurricanes making it almost impossible to come up with the 495 fee when they were dealing with devastation like a destroyed house
however she said shes hopeful that congress will pass legislation that will protect her and many others
i believe in the morality of treating people with respect and the positive change that undocumented immigrants have brought to this country she said

louisiana police have announced arrest warrants for 10 people accused of a role in forcing a university student to drink himself to death last month
all the suspects are affiliated with the social club that police say 18yearold maxwell gruver was attempting to join when he died
one louisiana state university student is charged with negligent homicide and nine others are charged with hazing
police believe gruver died after a fraternity ritual called bible study
according to a police affidavit on the night of 13 september gruver had been forced to drink during a phi delta theta initiation each time he incorrectly answered questions about the universitys allmale club
gruver died of acute alcohol intoxication with aspiration according to a postmortem examination by the east baton rouge parish coroner
the georgianative had a blood alcohol level that was over six times the legal limit for driving
todays arrests underscore that the ramifications of hazing can be devastating said university president f king alexander on wednesday
maxwell gruvers family will mourn his loss for the rest of their lives and several other students are now facing serious consequences all due to a series of poor decisions he continued
one suspect matthew naquin is charged with negligent homicide which could carry a fiveyear prison sentence
the others face charges of hazing which carry a 1030 day jail sentence

you can see national identity coming through in the games as they draw on aspects of their own cultural histories to make their work stand out in a crowded marketplace said matthew handrahan editor in chief at gamesindustrybiz a website that tracks trends in international gaming markets

in the north american market the types of games that become blockbusters are comparatively homogeneous
in latin america there is a greater emphasis on pc games particularly freetoplay ones than console games that is because people cannot pay for anything in an online game without a credit card which brazilian gamers typically do not use
other challenges like internet infrastructure and a complicated tax system that imposes high import rates on products not made in the country have stopped latin america from obtaining some video game systems at an affordable price an xbox 360 cost the equivalent of 1450 in latin america when it first appeared about three times the price in the united states mr handrahan said
marcelo tavares a former video game reporter created the brasil game show after attending e3 in 2006 the inaugural event in 2009 attracted just 4000 visitors
the biggest challenges were to gain the trust of the public and companies to have them here mr tavares said in each edition of the show we have to push expectations further in order to please everyone visitors and exhibitors alike

the shows popularity has helped to show the opportunity in the brazilian market in august a japanese video game designer hideo kojima creator of the highly successful metal gear solid franchise published by konami said he would attend the brasil game show for the first time to receive a lifetime achievement award as well as to participate in a panel about his professional career and meet fans

"__label__fake by catherine j frompovich
in february of 2012 three attorneys with the congressional research service crs issued a lengthy report smart meter data privacy and cybersecurity which addressed many of the same questions consumers have about those hightech utility meters being forced on to customers electric natural gas and water utility services in every state and globally ive read the entire report and think consumers ought to know the more significant parts and information regarding your rights to privacy and security
the crs is a government agency basically providing background information about certain issues or topics members of congress or congressional committees want to know more about
nothing is a hot button privacy and health issue more than ami smart meters which are retrofitted in place of safe analog meters that have been in exemplary use for decades the new ami sms have one advantage over the safe analog meters which probably appeals to the united nations ami sms spy on the occupants inside the homes to which ami sms are retrofitted those personal rights violations are real and should be of valid concern to consumers who know their us constitutional and state constitutional rights are being violated and abrogated
apparently those same issues may have been on the minds of some members of congress therefore the request for a privacy and cybersecurity report
in the summary of that report we find
fueled by stimulus funding in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra electric utilities have accelerated their deployment of smart meters to millions of homes across the united states with help from the department of energys smart grid investment grant program as the meters multiply so do issues concerning the privacy and security of the data collected by the new technology this advanced metering infrastructure ami promises to increase energy efficiency bolster electric power grid reliability and facilitate demand response among other benefits however to fulfill these ends smart meters must record nearreal time data on consumer electricity usage and transmit the data to utilities over great distances via communications networks that serve the smart grid detailed electricity usage data offers a window into the lives of people inside of a home by revealing what individual appliances they are using and the transmission of the data potentially subjects this information to interception or theft by unauthorized third parties or hackers cjf emphasis
rather nonchalantly in this writers opinion the reports authors concede
unforeseen consequences under federal law may result from the installation of smart meters and the communications technologies that accompany them this report examines federal privacy and cybersecurity laws that may apply to consumer data collected by residential smart meters it begins with an examination of the constitutional provisions in the fourth amendment that may apply to the data as we progress into the 21st century access to personal data including information generated from smart meters is a new frontier for police investigations the fourth amendment generally requires police to have probable cause to search an area in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy however courts have used the thirdparty doctrine to deny protection to information a customer gives to a business as part of their commercial relationship this rule is used by police to access bank records telephone records and traditional utility records nevertheless there are several core differences between smart meters and the general thirdparty cases that may cause concerns about its application these include concerns expressed by the courts and congress about the ability of technology to potentially erode individuals privacy if smart meter data and transmissions fall outside of the protection of the fourth amendment they may still be protected from unauthorized disclosure or access under the stored communications act sca the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa and the electronic communications privacy act ecpa these statutes however would appear to permit law enforcement to access smart meter data for investigative purposes under procedures provided in the sca ecpa and the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa subject to certain conditions additionally an electric utilitys privacy and security practices with regard to consumer data may be subject to section 5 of the federal trade commission act ftc act the federal trade commission ftc has recently focused its consumer protection enforcement on entities that violate their privacy policies or fail to protect data from unauthorized access this authority could apply to electric utilities in possession of smart meter data provided that the ftc has statutory jurisdiction over them general federal privacy safeguards provided under the federal privacy act of 1974 fpa protect smart meter data maintained by federal agencies including data held by federally owned electric utilities cjf emphasis
how come state public utility commissions their kangaroo courts and utility companies attorneys arent held accountable to the legitimate seriousness of the above constitutional issues let alone the escalating adverse health effects from ami smart meter radiofrequencies nonthermal radiation waves that now scientifically have been proven to break dna bonds
on page 2 of that report the crs lawyers say
general federal privacy safeguards provided under the federal privacy act of 1974 fpa protect smart meter data maintained by federal agencies including data held by federally owned electric utilities section 5 of the federal trade commission act ftc act allows the federal trade commission ftc to bring enforcement proceedings against electric utilities that violate their privacy policies or fail to protect meter data from unauthorized access provided that the ftc has statutory jurisdiction over the utilities it is unclear how fourth amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizures would apply to smart meter data due to the lack of cases on this issue however depending upon the manner in which smart meter services are presented to consumers smart meter data may be protected from unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access under the stored communications act sca the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa and the electronic communications privacy act ecpa if smart meter data is protected by these statutes law enforcement would still appear to have the ability to access it for investigative purposes under procedures provided in the sca ecpa and the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa cjf emphasis
page 3 addresses smart meter data privacy and security concerns
residential smart meters present privacy and cybersecurity issues 19 that are likely to evolve with the technology20 in 2010 the national institute of standards and technology nist published a report identifying some of these issues which fall into two main categories 1 privacy concerns that smart meters will reveal the activities of people inside of a home by measuring their electricity usage frequently over time21and 2 fears that inadequate cybersecurity measures surrounding the digital transmission of smart meter data will expose it to misuse by authorized and unauthorized users of the data cjf emphasis
while addressing specific details the report claims
smart meters offer a significantly more detailed illustration of a consumers energy usage than regular meters traditional meters display data on a consumers total electricity usage and are typically read manually once per month23 in contrast smart meters can provide near realtime usage data by measuring usage electronically at a much greater frequency such as once every 15 minutes24 current smart meter technology allows utilities to measure usage as frequently as once every minute25 by examining smart meter data it is possible to identify which appliances a consumer is using and at what times of the day because each type of appliance generates a unique electric load signature26 which will tie into the internet of things nist wrote in 2010 that research shows that analyzing 15minute interval aggregate household energy consumption data can by itself pinpoint the use of most major home appliances 27 a report for the colorado public utilities commission discussed an italian study that used artificial neural networks to identify individual heavyload appliance uses with 90 accuracy using 15minute interval data from a smart meter28 similarly softwarebased algorithms would likely allow a person to extract the unique signatures of individual appliances from meter data that has been collected less frequently and is therefore less detailed29 one algorithm program is onzo 2 by combining appliance usage patterns an observer could discern the behavior of occupants in a home over a period of time30 for example the data could show whether a residence is occupied how many people live in it and whether it is occupied by more people than usual31 according to the department of energy smart meters may be able to reveal occupants daily schedules including times when they are at or away from home or asleep whether their homes are equipped with alarm systems whether they own expensive electronic equipment such as plasma tvs and whether they use certain types of medical equipment32 figure 1 which appears in nists report on smart grid cybersecurity shows how smart meter data could be used to decipher the activities of a homes occupants by matching data on their electricity usage with known appliance load signatures cjf emphasis
here is the part about ami sms that really needs to be understood and factored in to the privacy and security paradigm the microwave industry utility companies and even state public utility commissions which should know better are not paying attention to nor dealing with potential for theft or breach of data like we had with the equifax data breach affecting about half of the countrys consumers
increased potential for theft or breach of data smart grid technology relies heavily on twoway communication to increase energy efficiency and reliability including communication between smart meters and the utility or other entity that stores data for the grid46 many different technologies will transmit data to the grid including traditional twistedcopper phone lines cable lines fiber optic cable cellular satellite microwave wimax power line carrier and broadband over power line47 of these communications platforms wireless technologies are likely to play a prominent role because they present fewer safety concerns and cost less to implement than wireline technologies48 according to the department of energy a typical utility network has four tiers that collect and transmit data from the consumer to the utility49 these include 1 the core backbonethe primary path to the utility data center 2 backhaul distributionthe aggregation point for neighborhood data 3 the access pointtypically the smart meter and 4 the hanthe home network50 energy usage data moves from the smart meter51 and then to an aggregation point outside of the residence such as a substation a utility polemounted device or a communications tower52 cjf emphasis
two us supreme court decisions kyllo v united states 1 and united states v karo have defended the home as a sacred site at the core of the fourth amendment
kyllo and karo demonstrate that the supreme court has defended the home as a sacred site at the core of the fourth amendment169 although neither the supreme court nor any lower federal court has ruled on the use of smart meters a few propositions can be deduced from kyllo and karo bearing on this question because smart meters allow law enforcement to access information regarding intimate details occurring inside the home a highly invasive investigation that could not otherwise be performed without intrusion into the home a court may require a warrant to access this data in kyllo the police merely obtained the relative temperatures of a house170 and in karo the police only generally located the beeper in the house171 although this information was limited the court nonetheless prohibited such investigatory techniques smart meters have the potential to produce significantly more information than that derived in kyllo and karo including what individual appliances we are using whether our house is empty or occupied and when we take our daily shower or bath172 further a look at figure 1 supra makes it clear that this level of information is much more intimate than prior technologies used by law enforcement this depth of intrusion suggests that customers may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in smart meter data cjf emphasis
the crs lawyers thought there iswas statutory protection of smart meter data
question which law school courses did they take that utility company lawyers and public utility commissions judges somehow missed during law school
this section discusses federal statutory protections that may be applicable to the contents of communications sent by a smart meter independent of the fourth amendment while they are either stored within the smart meter prior to transmission during transmission or after they have been delivered to the utility three federal laws the electronic communications privacy act ecpa199 the stored communications act sca200 and the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa201 may be applicable to these situations and are discussed in more detail below cjf emphasis
how come public utility commission administrative law judges dont recognize those federal laws enforce them from the bench and in their decisions by automatically ruling in favor of consumers who reject ami sms good question
since ami sms basically are sophisticated computers that will have to be replaced every five to six years with updated meters the computer fraud and abuse act may be applied to ami sms privacy issues
the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa prohibits intentionally accessing and obtaining information from a computer used in or affecting interstate commerce without authorization or in excess of a granted authorization246 the definition of a computer for purposes of the cfaa is an electronic magnetic optical electrochemical or other high speed data processing device performing logical arithmetic or storage functions and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device excluding an automated typewriter or typesetter a portable hand held calculator or other similar device247 the servers on a utilitys network would likely fall squarely within the definition of a computer under the cfaa similarly smart meters themselves also appear to meet the definition of a computer insofar as they store customers energy usage data and also perform logical operations by routing transmissions across the utilitys network additionally in light of the significant role that energy utilities play in the modern economy the smart meter network would also likely be considered to have an effect on interstate commerce even if they operate entirely within one state therefore intentionally gaining access to the utilitys servers or smart meters to obtain customer data would likely constitute a violation of the cfaa if done without the utilitys authorization or in excess of an authorization granted by the utility cjf emphasis
heres a nice part about the cfaa the fines which should be incentive enough for everyone to file complaints against utility companies with their state attorney general or state public utility commission
the criminal penalties for violating the unauthorized access provisions of the cfaa have a three tier sentencing structure simple violations are punished as misdemeanors imprisonment for not more than one year andor a fine of not more than 100000 200000 for organizations248
another law that comes into play is section 5 of the federal trade commission act
section 5 of the ftc act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce251 and gives the federal trade commission ftc jurisdiction to bring enforcement actions against persons partnerships or corporations that engage in these practices252 in the past the ftc has used its authority under section 5 to take action against businesses that violate their own privacy policies or that fail to adequately safeguard a consumers personal information253 although there do not appear to be any cases in which the ftc has taken action against an electric utility for failing to protect consumer smart meter data the commission would have authority to enforce section 5 against a utility that fell within its statutory jurisdiction
on page 40 of the report the lawyers mention another issue that can be relevant
unfair failure to secure consumer data failure to protect against common technology threats or unauthorized access the firearms survival guide ad the ftc may consider it an unfair practice when an electric utility fails to safeguard smart meter data from wellknown technology threats as the data travels across the utilitys communications networks cjf emphasis
furthermore and even more importantly all parties involved in the ami sm legal debacles must realize what the crs lawyers have to say about ami sm data protection
smart meter data as a protected record
the privacy act protects the type of electricity usage data gathered by smart meters provided that the data pertains to us citizens or permanent residents is personally identifiable and is retrievable by the individuals name or another personal identifier the privacy act governs the collection use and dissemination of a record about an individual maintained by federal agencies in a system of records368 under the statute a record is any item collection or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency that contains his name or the identifying number symbol or other identifying particular assigned to the individual such as a finger or voice print or a photograph369 an individual is defined as a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence370 a system of records is a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or other personal identifier assigned to the individual371 smart meter data held by an agency certainly fits within the broad definition of a record because it is a grouping of information about an individual namely data on that individuals electricity usage the data is typically stored along with a consumers account information which usually includes a consumers name social security number or other identifying particular372 thus smart meter data would constitute a protected record under the privacy act assuming that it pertains to a citizen of the united states or lawful permanent resident and is retrievable by a personal identifier such as a consumers name or account number cjf emphasis
all the above only confirms why the energy policy act of 2005 public law 10958 section 1252 smart metering does not mandate or make ami smart meters mandatory that would be unconstitutional yet public utility commissions dont respect the foremost law of the land the us constitution
apparently there is a copy of a member of congress letter circulating on the internet wherein that congressperson says as you may know provisions within the 2005 energy policy act allow for consumers to opt out of smart meter programs that are run at the state level
this writers comment
since the equifax credit bureau hacking tragedy plus other numerous privacy security and identity theft problems with computers credit card companies and corporations that manage them one would think state agencies in particular should be determined to protect consumers constitutional rights to privacy and personal data and not provide opportunities for personal data to be compromised from cyberattacks especially since utility companies definitely will not be sending consumers data over secure networks

is this the same guy i know a lot of people look the same i also do not believe every person that died in las vegas was an actor do i think maybe some weirdo black ops stuff involved sure anything is possible someone may have did this to spark a civil war between left and right lots of different theories out there right now lots of infiltrated news from our real enemies i am sure what do you think is this the same guy really i dont know honestly
 
now let us get to the 4chan prophetic part of this post revolving the las vegas shootings the following details the information regarding this connection the source of squawkerorg
emigrate while you still can learn more
 
3 weeks ago on 911 a mysterious 4chan user who went only by john made a series of at the time overlooked posts he warned users to stay away from any gatherings of large groups of people in the vegas or nearby henderson areas stating that he had insider knowledge of what he referred to as a high incident project that was set to occur soonwhile the poster was ignored at the time since nothing seemed to occur on the 12th the fact this john wrote i cant guarantee anything will happen tomorrow but las vegas is on their minds seems almost frightening now that just a few weeks later the largest mass shooting in american history has occurred at this very location if we even consider the idea there could be any truth to such a plot in the first place its not really all that unreasonable to believe the organizers could have simply adjusted there schedule by a few weeks this could have been done for a myriad of reasons including just simply deciding the concert target eventually chosen served their purposes better if true though even more troubling is the profit minded motivation behind the shooting that john went on to describehe states this project will be done with an endgame goal of passing new laws in nevada regarding casino security making pricey new security screening machines mandatory for all guests with even further more ambitious plans to follow suit in our schools and other public buildings if the public goes along with the casino machines easily enough he also specifically names former head of the department of homeland security michael chertoff and casino owner and billionaire sheldon adelson as the two men set to profit most off the wave of new regulations set to spring up in response to the vegas incident its not all that unreasonable even to believe that mr chertoff might seek to profit from a new security panic in the wake of vegas given that the man has already been accused of abusing the public trust by raising security fears among average americans in an attempt to sell his companies body scanners before all the way back in 2010
 
while the media paints the shooter stephen paddock as a lone wolf type and seems mystified over the possible motivations for a man who the media and fbi at least keep claiming had no religious or strong political ideologies a new theory has been emerging in the wake of the revelations above with new information now breaking that the shooter was a rather active vegas gambler with recent large transactions to his name could stephen have simply been threatened into doing this horrible act by some third party in the name of paying off some possible large gambling debts his family as well may have been threatened if stephen wasnt acting of his own accord then a number of the seemingly unexplained parts to this whole story do start making a lot more sense
 
even if this is all one giant coincidence the fact does remain that people like chertoff and those behind similar companies do stand to profit quite nicely in the months to come from the new security panic this incident will likely produce recent headlines related to the topic going to prove this point nicely

deadliest mass shooting in modern us history
various agencies are investigating what led stephen paddock to shoot from the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay hotel into a crowd of some 22000 concertgoers paddock killed more than 58 people and wounded nearly 500
las vegas police said they did not know stephen paddocks name before the shooting and they believe he acted alone he bought multiple firearms in the past but investigators believe the firearms were purchased legally a law enforcement official said a mesquite store guns guitars said it sold a gun to paddock and that he never gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time
police found at least 23 weapons inside his hotel room including multiple rifles some with scopes at least one rifle may have been altered to function as an automatic weapon a law enforcement official said
stephen paddock in an undated photo
were up all night because we gamble
eric paddock said he knew his brother had firearms his children had gone skeetshooting with their uncle before but eric did not know stephen to be a hunter
eric helped his brother drive across the country in 2016 to a new home in mesquite nevada a retiree community about 80 miles northeast of las vegas along the way the brothers ate sushi and drank late into the evening eric paddock recalled but he did not recall his brother bringing a machine gun along with him
however he acknowledged the limits of his knowledge living thousands of miles from a brother he only spoke to occasionally
stephen paddock lived in mesquite with his girlfriend 62yearold marilou danley she was out of the country during the shooting but returned tuesday and was questioned by law enforcement
he might have kept quiet about the guns but he wasnt shy about the gambling
when he bought a house in mesquite he wrote on his application that his income came from gambling he also told a real estate agent that he gambled about 1 million a year an agent speaking on condition of anonymity said
he sought privacy and kept a low profile some of his neighbors rarely saw him but they knew he was a gambler

a search of stephen paddocks home in mesquite turned up at least 19 additional firearms explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition clark county sheriff joseph lombardo said monday night several pounds of ammonium nitrate a material used to make explosives were found in paddocks car
that came as a surprise to one of his former neighbors if there was any impression i would say guy had no idea what a gun was said judy who lived next door to stephen paddock from 20132015 in a retirement community in melbourne florida
paddock never stayed at the house for very long judy said sometimes he came with his girlfriend sometimes without

stephen paddock held various federal jobs in the 1970s and 80s he was a us postal service letter carrier in the mid to late 70s an agent with the internal revenue service from 1978 to 1984 and worked for the defense contract audit agency in 1984 and 1985 the us office of personnel management said
eric paddock said his brother also was a successful real estate investor who owned apartments and houses records link him over the years to more than nine houses condos and apartment buildings in nevada florida and california
investigators were looking monday at several properties in the reno area associated with stephen paddock

"__label__real this was a break from the usual for rock acts in general and this one in particular it was weird and conceptual in all the ways mr pettys music was vividly normal they were casting themselves as survivors of some prevideo age i dont think i actually heard you got lucky because i had seen it and it looked stoned

in the week or so since his death last monday mr petty has been memorialized as carrying some kind of classicrock baton which came as a surprise to me since all my first encounters with him happened on mtv thats a rockcritic distinction and it makes sense for the purists to lay their claim mr petty has never sounded out of place in a block crammed with say stairway to heaven hotel california and legs but mr petty belonged as much to mtv alongside duran duran and cyndi lauper as he did to the oldguard rigidity of whatever is meant by classic rock
its true there was a classicism to his approach to rock whether he was on his own recording with the heartbreakers or with the traveling wilburys a sort of rockhistorical avengers but his elasticity and economy a tom petty song rarely made it past the fourminute mark and the sweet spot it deeply satisfied over and over were hallmarks of pop
mr pettys nuttiest contribution to the video era was dont come around here no more from 1985 it riffs on the mad hatters tea party from alice in wonderland with mr petty as the hatter the props edible teacups mushroom tuffets and costumes were surreally proportioned and druggie mr petty briefly either shrinks inside his outfit or his clothes turn enormous but whats freaky about the clip is what a creep he pretends to be leaping from one end of the enormous dining table to where alice sits at the other and appearing to chase her around the checkerboard set
eventually shes trapped in the teacup and her body turns into a cake that the band and the hatter all find good enough to eat so they hack into her in the final shot the camera pans from a screaming alice to a closeup of mr petty gobbling her up he wears the same bemused expression the entire time and courtesy of his sunglasses never lets you see his eyes he was opiumden willy wonka it was a look hed often return to

if dont come around here is your second or third tom petty musicvideo experience it may have been formative michael jackson was a werewolfzombie madonna rolled around in gondolas prince did splits tom petty ate people i always found that funny given how little his face appeared to do youd watch these videos and wonder how such a pleasingly distinctive sound could come out of a mouth that never seemed to open
mr pettys approach to being on mtv was not to take it more seriously than he had to his sense of frivolity came with a coating of strangerdanger i wont back down kicks off with him still outfitted like the mad hatter lifting the lid of a gift box the camera peers inside revealing mr petty and a band playing the song on a stark black set before the guitars start to cry and chug theres a natural studio silence that always terrified me who knows why but some of it is the darkmagician hed styled himself as
the hat and the shades seemed to keep him in disguise it took a long time to remember that when his career in music videos started with refugee to pick one hypnotically shabbylooking performance he looked like the average girls prom date cuter than you thought by the time of into the great wide open from 1991 mr petty wore another ridiculous hat and wirerimmed glasses this time the mad hatter was an omniscient narrator of the songs musicbiz blues its an imaginative fitfully humorous literalizing of the song johnny depp plays eddie a cliché rock star and faye dunaway has a ball portraying his backstabbed manager mr petty himself takes on about four different parts the musicvideo veteran julian temple directed it and he worked with a poignant tinge of bloat accordingly to mr petty in peter bogdanovichs exhaustingly thorough documentary runnin down a dream mr temple originally shot a 17minute version
the videos got at a kind of truth about mr petty lots of his songs featured power contests between himself and unspecified forces like record labels commands like dont wont stop and quit recur maybe some of the clips were a fantasy of a straightforward control he struggled for in his music of course as a listener you often heard struggles opposite you felt the joy of the musics thrum and jangle the songs took threechord structure and made little origami in videos he never seemed impressed

that was the other thing about them watching them was an exercise in cognitive dissonance for the dramatization of the ecstasy a listener feels hearing a tom petty song you had to go to the movies you had to see tom cruise in cameron crowes jerry maguire searching a car radio for a song that matched his moneyloving mood settling on free fallin its one of the most casually human things mr cruise has done in a movie he practically hits the roof of his car by the time the chorus comes around
jerry of course is hearing the bright side of a song whose sense of loneliness never occurs to mr cruise but the movie gets the irony that really jerry is wile e coyote out of road to run
then theres brooke smith in jonathan demmes the silence of the lambs rocking out to american girl theres only one way to experience this song and smiths is it pounding on the steering wheel mr petty really is one of those artists who makes you feel like you could drive a car forever smiths character is about to be beaten unconscious trapped in a van and made to live at the bottom of a dry well but for a brief moment shes happy feeling the opposite of what mr pettys song is actually about letdowns
that of course was his cleverness as a writer he wrote majorkey bummers a listener didnt know what was hitting him until he knew obviously mr petty knew the young me was never ready for those old petty videos to a kid that wile e coyote feeling describes a cartoon for everybody else its just life"
"__label__real washington cnn the trump administration dropped a potential bomb into negotiations on the future of the deferred action for childhood arrivals policy on sunday night but key players on the hill still arent sure yet whether the fuse is actually lit
reaction to the administrations priorities list of tough border security and immigration enforcement measures ranged from dismissal as noise to skepticism about the presidents commitment level to declarations of it being a nonstarter by democrats
ultimately most agree president donald trump himself will have to say what his red lines are
the white house late sunday released a wish list of items for any potential deal to preserve daca the obama administration policy that protects young undocumented immigrants brought to the us as children from deportation those measures include provisions to make it harder for unaccompanied minors to enter the country illegally money for the presidents border wall and cuts to legal immigration
but the administration is already sending mixed messages about how intensely it is getting behind the list of priorities which were developed in part by stephen miller a white house policy adviser and longtime immigration hardliner
an administration source told cnn that it was too early to tell whether the priorities are a firm line in the sand saying there remains a white house divided on the issue but emphasizing trump still wants to cut a deal
on a call with reporters on sunday night a senior administration official declined to say whether the list should be read as a veto threat
were not discussing whats a veto threat right now or were not looking to negotiate with ourselves the official said adding the priorities are all important
on capitol hill most players are taking a waitandsee approach
house speaker paul ryans office was noncommittal the house immigration working group will review these principles and continue to consult with our conference and the administration to find a solution spokesman doug andres said
other sources pointed to the timing of the release the sunday night before a federal holiday as a possible indication the white house is not as serious about the list
like theyre trying to bury it one congressional aide said administration sources for their part said the list had been in the works for some time and was simply ready to be released
a republican consultant familiar with the discussions on the hill about daca downplayed the release altogether as noise saying not much matters until the date draws nearer to december 8 when government funding runs out and any potential shutdown talk could get serious if progress hasnt been made
i just dont take this as that serious a proposal the consultant said one given whats in there that its everything under the sun and two when they released it
at the same time one senior democratic aide called it most disheartening that in the letter trump sent to congressional democratic leadership he said the list must be passed
millers involvement has been a source of frustration for some negotiators on both sides of the aisle who have perceived him as trying to scuttle talks
this isnt an opening bid that anyones going to respond to said jeremy robbins executive director of new american economy a nonpartisan group businesslinked group backed by former mayor mike bloomberg that advocates for moderate immigration policies theres just this laundry list of deal breakers each one of which is a poison pill in its own right but that doesnt change the fact that the president if he wants to protect dreamers and get some border security he can do that today
hill work continues
sources familiar with negotiations in congress say they have been progressing slowly
according to multiple sources familiar the working group organized by ryan which includes key republicans on different sides of the ideological spectrum has met at least four times the bare bones of a deal have yet to take shape the sources said
further details remain on close hold members and their staffs have agreed to maintain silence on the substance of the discussions to avoid negotiations leaking to the press
on the senate side sources familiar say conversations are happening mostly among staff but the process is less formal than on the house side
democrats maintain substantial leverage in the negotiations not only would any immigration deal require democratic votes to pass both to clear the 60vote filibuster threshold in the senate and to make up for republican holdouts who would never support a daca fix but democrats are already signaling they could withhold support for mustpass bills like government funding if progress isnt made
that is definitely on the table and we are working to make sure that its not just a hispanic caucus effort but its the entire democratic caucus said congressional hispanic caucus chairwoman michelle lujan grisham in a chc call with reporters on monday if we cant get movement on a productive strategy that gives us a vote and were open to considering reasonable effective border security issues then yes were going to use every leverage point at our disposal
a deal is still attainable added vice chairman joaquin castro but only if the white house is reasonable

the comments from lawmakers including the no 2 senate republican john cornyn of texas marked a surprising departure from gop lawmakers general antipathy to gun regulations of any kind but they were far from a guarantee of a path forward for the new legislation by sen dianne feinstein dcalif especially with majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan making clear their priorities are elsewhere
if somebody can essentially convert a semiautomatic weapon by buying one of these and utilizing it and cause the kind of mayhem and mass casualties that we saw in las vegas thats something of obvious concern that we ought to explore cornyn told reporters
i own a lot of guns and as a hunter and sportsman i think thats our right as americans but i dont understand the use of this bump stock and thats another reason to have a hearing
cornyn later said hed spoken with judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley and that grassley was interested in convening a hearing
the devices known as bump stocks among other names are legal and originally were intended to help people with limited hand mobility fire a semiautomatic without the individual trigger pulls required they can fit over the rear shoulderstock assembly on a semiautomatic rifle and with applied pressure cause the weapon to fire continuously increasing the rate from between 45 and 60 rounds per minute to between 400 and 800 rounds per minute according to feinsteins office
the government gave its seal of approval to selling the devices in 2010 after concluding that they did not violate federal law
feinstein has a careerlong history on the issue of guns after becoming mayor in san francisco after her predecessor was gunned down she authored an assault weapons ban that was in place for a decade before expiring in 2004 and said she had been considering trying to reintroduce that more sweeping legislation as shes done unsuccessfully after past mass shootings including the one at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut senate minority leader chuck schumer urged her to go with a narrower bill that might be likelier to draw support
feinstein pleaded with the public to pressure congress to consider her legislation after the horrific violence earlier this week when a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor concert that she said her own daughter had considered attending
mr and mrs america you have to stand up you have to say enough is enough feinstein said why cant we keep a weapon from becoming a militarygrade weapon
the national rifle association which has played a major role in exerting political pressure against gun curbs did not respond to inquiries about its stance on feinsteins bill
at least one republican senator ron johnson of wisconsin said outright he was prepared to vote to ban bump stocks i have no problem in banning those he said
sen john thune of south dakota the no 3 republican senator said im interest in finding out more about bump stocks and ive got my staff looking into that and i know there are other members interested in finding out more about it as well
even so asked tuesday about bump stocks and whether they should be legal mcconnell rky said it was not an appropriate time to be discussing legislation
ryan rwis made similar comments wednesday in a radio interview on wisn in milwaukee
what i dont think you want your government to do is to lurch toward reactions before even having all the facts ryan said bad people are going to do bad things
in the house meanwhile rep david cicilline dri introduced a bill to ban the manufacture possession transfer sale or importation of bump stocks rep dina titus dnev whose district includes the site of sunday nights rampage said the victims and families in las vegas dont need an explanation about the difference between machine guns and firearms with bump stocks they need action
congress recent history gives little cause to think republicans would take any action on guns even after the 2012 sandy hook shooting where schoolchildren were slaughtered feinsteins reintroduced assault weapons ban went nowhere and bipartisan background check legislation by democratic sen joe manchin of west virginia and republican sen pat toomey of pennsylvania fell short on the senate floor
last year after the mass shooting at a dance club in orlando florida democrats commandeered the house floor to protest gop inaction on guns but while garnering headlines the tactic did not yield results shooting incidents involving lawmakers themselves like at a baseball practice earlier this year where majority whip steve scalise was critically injured have not changed the calculus
feinstein held out hope that this time would be different because of the scale of casualties and the weaponry taking it into war and manchin said that he planned to meet with toomey on the background checks bill but would not reintroduce it without significant gop support which he said aint going to happen unless the president gives his stamp of approval
president donald trump visited las vegas on wednesday but said were not going to talk about that today when asked about gun issues

"__label__real cnn most parents have experienced it that moment when their son or daughter has a fullblown temper tantrum which may involve screaming crying stomping their feet dropping to the floor or all of the above
of course this is stressful no matter where it happens but when its in a public place and you feel as if everyone is looking at you and thinking what kind of parent cant control his or her kid you may want to curl up in a ball and start screaming yourself
but you know that wont really be productive so what can you do
for some answers we turned the camera on kids themselves a group of new jersey fifth and sixthgraders many of whom admitted having tantrums at one time or another
grace szostak who just started middle school says she had them until the third grade and could be found banging on the doors in her room
it was not good she conceded
as part of a new video series if i were a parent showcasing kids taking on modernday parenting problems i asked grace and her classmates what they would do if their son or daughter had a tantrum
id say cool down cool down and id sit with them and talk to them about it said lance jenkins who is in the sixth grade
and if they dont calm down thats the hard part he admitted
casey wescott whos also in the sixth grade said parents are sometimes quick to just react and may not take the time to figure out why their children are crying try to slow down a little more and ask your kids what is wrong he said
fiona laddey a fifthgrader said its important for parents to stay calm because if you start yelling it would be even more chaos
family therapist tricia ferrara is author of parenting 20
tricia ferrara a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the philadelphia area for more than a decade agrees
ferrara author of parenting 20 think in the future act in the now said that while it may be hard to do we need to forget about the other people who may be watching us during those cringeinducing moments when our children are in the throes of a tantrum
i always say to parents youve got to stop drop and do what you have to do ferrara said during a previous interview escalating back to the child is not helping anything because thats more sensory information that is going to make them go nuclear
think of yourself as a tuning fork she said the calmer and clearer you can be the better things will go
adults should look for creative ways to maintain authority and realize that eliciting even small concessions from a child can go a long way ferrara said create one bit of upside even if its you take one breath and we count to three together and then we can get you what you want and then well go home she explained what that does is it keeps you in control and as the authority in the situation
the biggest mistake parents can make
totally giving in to the tantrum is never a good way to go experts say and children themselves seem to understand why thats not a good plan
that teaches them oh my parents give in so i can throw more tantrums and get everything i want said toniann garruto a fifthgrader
a child might think oh i can throw a temper tantrum and i can get a cookie if i stop so im going to throw a temper tantrum five seconds later and then stop said sean wescott whos in middle school
casey seans twin brother added if you give in thats going to occur more and more and you dont want that to happen
too many parents this mother included dont realize that there are things you can do to prevent a meltdown ferrara said
when kids are tired and hungry they cant tell you whats going on so its probably best to avoid errands at the end of the day when its harder for kids to coordinate their emotions with their bodies she said i joked in a previous story how i wished i had this information when my kids were little had i know then what i know now i probably wouldnt have taken them grocery shopping right before dinner time
the biggest mistake parents make is going into situations without a strategy ferrara said do you go to the hairdresser without a plan a business meeting go buy a car no but we always allow ourselves to fall into these potholes with our kids with no plan she said
if your child tends to have tantrums if they dont get what they want you can tell them that how they behave is going to determine whether they are going to get to do something later such as play with birthday presents or have a play date with friends
tell us your story tell us your story
we love to hear from our audience follow cnnhealth on twitter and facebook for the latest health news and let us know what were missing
and during an outing if your child starts to behave in a way that is unacceptable instead of getting into a verbal joust with them you can say do you want to play with your birthday presents you can remain clear and calm and communicate in a way that they understand ferrara said
there is always another option when your kid has a tantrum in a public place joked tyler schlegel a fifthgrader if he were a parent he said with a smile id go home"

notes
there is no way antonio brown is going to benched in any league this week that said he is not going to be someone i target in dfs and brown is also not deserving of the top spot in these rankings last week didnt go according to plan and his displeasure was quite evident on the sideline brown caught just four passes for 34 yards last week as leveon bell was the focus of pittsburghs offensive game plan despite the fact that brown is second in the nfl in targets and has two games of 100plus yards i would expect to see that continue this week jacksonville has the toughest defense in the league against opposing wide receivers and jalen ramsey appears to be a formidable foe with 388 yards so far this season this likely represents the lowest browns value will be
this week i would look for pierre garcon to continue on his pace of alternating good games with duds matched up against patrick peterson last week garcon caught four passes on eight targets for 36 yards in the two games where san franciscos new receiver has been successful he has 13 catches for 223 yards compared to seven receptions for 62 yards in his other two games garcon is still looking for his first touchdown of the season and there is a good chance it comes this week against the colts and their lackluster passing defense
tampa bay has just three games under their belt and desean jackson is still looking to firm up his chemistry with jameis winston last week the growing pains were evident on the sideline but two weeks ago jackson did have four catches for 84 yards and a touchdown against the vikings jacksons lack of success isnt for a lack of trying winston has targeted him 20 times in three games but he has just nine receptions all year the patriots pass defense has left a lot to be desired so far this season but if anything they will work to take away tampas best weapon mike evans that could leave some room to operate downfield for jackson while i still have evans ranked ahead of jackson the big play threat is nice boom or bust play who we know will be targeted
while the chargers have yet to win a game this season keenan allen hasnt been at fault he has stayed healthy and last week caught nine passes for 138 yards while showing an impressive burst downfield not only has he been a ppr monster with a minimum of five catches each week he has also showed damage after the catch the giants defense has struggled so far but janoris jenkins is still a force to be reckoned with against the other teams top receiver since allen plays in the slot it is likely that tyrell williams will have to deal with jenkins
will fuller wasted no time jumping right back into the swing of things last week as he found the end zone twice after missing the first three games despite having limited practice time fuller showed some chemistry with deshaun watson as the two have spent time working together watson appears to be coming into his own as a passer but the sample size is still small and he is a rookie quarterback with that being said it was a good sign to see fuller involved in his first game of the season as he caught four passes for 32 yards on six targets
it sounds crazy to say but in his third nfl season devin funchess eclipsed four receptions for just the second time in his career perhaps he is finally coming into his own as he caught seven of his nine targets for 70 yards and two touchdowns they were the first two touchdowns of the season who finally took advantage of greg olson being sidelined that came after he caught four passes in each of his two previous games for 68 and 58 yards respectively with kelvin benjamin likely having to deal with darius slay this week that should open some room to work for funchess

the bsi has no indications at this time that the process occurred as described in the media
the new york times reported on tuesday that israeli intelligence officials spying on russian government hackers found they were using kaspersky software as a sort of google search to find sensitive data stored by us government agencies and others

the us government last month ordered kaspersky software removed from government computers saying it was concerned the moscowbased cyber security firm was vulnerable to kremlin influence
kaspersky lab has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in russian hack1ing kaspersky lab has never helped nor will help any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts a company statement said on tuesday in response to the new york times report

a few notes thoughts and links to previous articles on gang green to pass along
its not exactly time to put anyone in canton after just three games but the play of the jets rookie safeties have been extremely impressive through two games especially in coverage jamal adams hasnt allowed a completion since week one and pff provided this stat on fellow rookie marcus maye earlier today
marcus maye played 46 coverage snaps against mia he wasnt targeted once on the season 107 cov snaps 3 targets 29 yds allowed jets pff ny jets pff_nyjets september 25 2017
as much as jets fans knock the play of matt forte he has outperformed bilal powell over the past two games averaging 46 yards per carry to powells 24 rookie running back elijah mcguire has posted an average of 48 ypc during that same time period
you have to tip your cap to leonard williams and the rest of the defensive line for an incredible effort on sunday there may not have been big sack numbers but the unit did pressure jay cutler while holding jay ajayi to 16 yards on 11 carries even mo wilkerson who had just one tackle looked better than he has all season
if for no other reason those fans who can attend this weeks game against the jaguars should do so to honor the great kevin mawae who will be inducted in to the teams ring of honor
more important than just getting a win this past sunday was the fact that so many of the jets young players stood out on both sides of the ball take a look at our list here 
 if brian winters misses any more time and dakota dozier continues to play well in his place its not a good look for mike maccagnan who gave winters a huge contract this off season to avoid having winters hit free agency
defensive lineman lawrence thomas got some run at fullback on sunday
defensive lineman lawrence thomas played a bit of fullback against the dolphins and if youre wondering if he may see a carry from time to time it appears unlikely as the michigan state spartans used him exclusively as a blocker and receiver in his one season out of the backfield for the spartans butnever say never
for the third week in a row outside linebacker jordan jenkins turned in an impressive performance and seems to have picked up where he left off last season the same cant be said for juston burris who played well in the opener but has struggled since
after facing marshawn lynch and jay ajayi in backtoback weeks it wont get any easier for the jets defense as they prepare to take on rookie battering ram leonard fournette after an incredible performance against the dolphins 11 solo tackles 3 tackles for loss demario davis and his partner in crime darron lee may be tested up the middle once again
only five days til game day folks

police chief edson garutti told globo news that brothers joesley and wesley batista knew they had information that would impact the market and profited with trades with stocks and foreign currency before details of the plea deal and leniency agreement for the company were made public on may 17
the batista brothers saved as much as 138 million reais 44 million by selling jbs stock before its 97 percent fall on the following day jbs also bought dollar future contracts the dollar rose 82 percent on the day after the details of the plea deal were made public
in his plea bargain testimony joesley batista accused president michel temer of endorsing bribes the company paid to politicians setting off a crisis that led to corruption charges against the president

the 1975 ed sheeran wretch 32 and florence the machine have all got something in common each of them made their radio debuts after uploading songs to bbc music introducing
the service a ukwide initiative for unsigned acts turned 10 years old on wednesday and celebrated with a massive gig at the o2 academy in brixton south london
the show featured some of bbc introducings famous alumni including blossoms declan mckenna and nao

stockport indie heroes blossoms uploaded their first track to bbc introducing almost as soon as we started the band in august 2013
they didnt get played immediately but struck gold in 2014 when bbc radio manchesters introducing show picked out their song madeleine
the song went on to become a bonus track on their selftitled mercurynominated debut album
joe donavan drums youve got to have a good name something thats not too hard to put into google and easy to remember thats weirdly important
tom ogden vocals guitar obviously if the song is good itll get you attention but have you got more than just one do you like each other are you willing to drop everything else for the band
charlie salt guitar are you decent live as well thats a big part of it today because records dont sell that well
everything everything

everything everythings big break came in 2009 when bbc introducing added them to the lineup of the reading leeds festival
that was such a totemic thing says bassist jeremy pritchard it was the first festival we went to when we were teenagers
the quirky pop quartet went on to win a south bank award for best breakthrough artist and their last three albums have all hit the top 10
jonathan higgs vocals theres some practical things you can do when youre sending out demos people will listen most intently to the first 30 seconds thats just a fact so if youve got a song where something great happens early on send that one no one wants to hear a threeminute fade in as good as it may be
jeremy pritchard individuality on any level is the thing for all young artists try to pursue what you feel defines you and not what is fashionable or what you see other people doing theres a very fine line between influence and bandwaggoning
huw stephens
huw stephens has broken some of the uks biggest artists on his radio 1 show from florence the machine to jack garratt
along with his producers he listens to a wide range of submissions on bbc introducing as well as accepting recommendations from the 38 local radio shows who support the initiative
huw i think an artist knows when a song is ready to get played on the radio it doesnt need to be perfect bedroom demos are fine you can hear a good song cutting through any kind of recording malfunctions of problems
most of the time submitting one or two songs is better having said that slaves uploaded an entire album in 2012 and their local show in kent played every track backtoback so i guess there are no rules
nao

i uploaded my very very first song which was called black porch to bbc introducing and i remember getting an email back saying someones listening to your song and will be in contact with you soon says soul star nao
a former backing singer for jarvis cocker and kwabs she went on to collaborate with disclosure and mura masa before launching her solo career in earnest last year
her debut album for all we know earned her a brit nomination for best british female and was sampled on stormzys debut album gang signs and prayer
nao i dont think theres any trick if your first song doesnt get picked up or your second just keep putting music out
sometimes it happens really quickly and sometimes it takes a lot longer for me it took 14 years i studied music i was in an a capella group i was a vocal coach i sang in wedding bands i was a backing singer i was every type of singer before i was my favourite type me
so if you have perseverance and patience i promise you youll get there

declan mckenna i uploaded a bunch of demos when i was like 14 or 15 maybe two albums worth of songs from my bedroom only one of them has been rerecorded and ended up on my album but thats ok they dont need to go anywhere theyre just little memories
i spent so much time learning about what i like as an artist and how i like to write songs writing music is always about learning learning about the process or learning about yourself

"__label__fake dwayne the rock johnson has officially filed his 2020 presidential campaign with the election commission
 
in what would have felt like a bizarre dairy dream just a few years ago the wwe champion turned movie action hero could be taking on reality starsitting president donald trump to become the leader of the free world
 
according to records the official paperwork has been filed on behalf of the get smart star by a man from west virginia called kenton tilford
 
the connection between the two men is as of yet unknown
 
 
 
top 3 contenders for 2020
 
1 the rock
 2 mark zuckerberg
 3 milkshake duck
 
 
we have seen charismatic dwayne take on everything from earthquakes to mummyhunting archaeologists in his films
 
he has even shown comedic talent playing obama in a saturday night live skit before a podium labelled the rock johnson 2020
 
however now that the joke is fast becoming a reality what sort of president would he be is the american public tiring of celebrities trying their hand at politics
 
 
 
imagine the rock being our president and interrupting vladimir putin during a crucial meeting to tell him it doesnt matter what his name is
 
 
 
rumors have been circulating for quite some time back in june 2016 alyssa rosenberg from the washington post wrote an opinion piece which suggested that dwayne could be a viable candidate
 
here alyssa stressed how the rocks national and global popularity could prove to be an important factor when gathering support
 
alyssa also discussed the rocks clean noncontroversial political record
 
if he doesnt have policy or issue bona fides johnsons relative silence on substance also means he doesnt have a record that can be used to tar him as some sort of flipflopper
 
and he could also make a series of carefully selected charitable and political donations designed to start building a record of positions
 
its easier to teach talking points than charisma as sen ted cruz rtex experienced earlier this year
 
dwayne responded to the washington post piece on instagram calling it interesting and fun to read whilst stressing the need for strong honest leadership
 
at this point he was still just toying with the idea of going into politics having previously made the following statement
 
i cant deny that the thought of being governor the thought of being president is alluring
 
and beyond that it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on peoples lives on a global scale but there are a lot of other things i want to do first
 
however it is now clear that he was beginning to ponder over one pretty big ambition
 
 
 
sure the rock would make a better president than trump but so would an actual rock
 
 
 
in may this year the rock spoke with gq about the real possibility of running for presidency
 
here gq writer caity weaver praised dwaynes industrial strength patriotism with the athletic actor often taking to social media to give thanks to members of the armed forces
 
dwayne also gave a glimpse as to what his presidential style might look like making the following admission
 
personally i feel that if i were president poise would be important leadership would be important
 
taking responsibility for everybody if i didnt agree with someone on something i wouldnt shut them out i would actually include them
 
so far dwayne has remained pretty neutral when discussing what his political views are and is standing as an independent candidate rather than a democrat or a republican
 
he has in the past been a supporter of the republican party speaking at the republican national convention back in 2000 he has also been an active campaigner in encouraging young people to vote
 
time will tell whether or not there are some winning policies behind that winning smile

"__label__fake is this the end of american democracy
 
gary cohn the current white house national economic council director also the former president of goldman sachs recently explained that in his circles only morons pay the estate tax
 
im reminded of donald trumps comment that he didnt pay federal income taxes because he was smart and billionaire leona helmsleys only the little people pay taxes
 
what cohns is explaining is that nowadays it has become quite easy for the wealthy to pass their fortunes on to their children taxfree
 
although the estate tax applies only to estates over 11 million per couple wealthy families frequently avoid this by stashing their money in dynastic trust funds that escape additional taxation
 
img srchttpi2kymcdncomphotosimagesnewsfeed0004119649b5jpg
 
this likely plays a large role in explaining why revenues from the estate tax have been dropping for years even though wealth has become more concentrated in fewer hands in the united states currently the tax generates around 20 billion a year less than one percent of government revenues in the united states it only applies to around one in every 500 people
related articles
these 14 horrifying facts about pools will keep you on dry land forever
report saudi government funded a dry run for 911
 
despite this president trump and other republican leaders are planning to at least cut the tax and perhaps eliminate it altogether
 
cohn was also referring to another part of the tax code that similarly only impacts a small number of rich families the capital gains taxes paid on the soaring revenues of wealthy peoples stocks bonds mansions and works of art when they are sold
 
there is already a loophole to avoid paying the capital gains tax all that one has to do is hold on to these assets until they die and the tax code allows their heirs to inherit them without paying any capital gains tax since the assets were technically never sold the congressional budget office cbo estimates that this loophole saves heirs 50 billion a year
 
img srchttpswwwbriantracycomblogwpcontentuploads201206selfmademillionaireswealthypeoplefinancialfreedom800x800jpg
 
estate and capital gains taxes were created with the goal of preventing the growth of large financial dynasties in the us and to reduce economic inequality
 
however in recent decades they have been failing to do that today the richest onetenth of 1 percent of americans now own nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent of americans
 
on top of that a significant number of the superrich in the united states today never did a days work six out of the ten wealthiest americans alive today gained their wealth by being heirs to prominent fortunes for example the heirs to walmart alone have more wealth than the bottom 42 of americans
 
this trend looks to continue as rich millennials will soon acquire even more of the nations wealth
 
america is now facing the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in world history as many wealthy babyboomers pass away an estimated 30 trillion will go to their children over the next quarter century
 
these children will be able to live simply off of the income these assets generate and then leave that fortune which will have grown simply through investment to their own heirs taxfree
 
it quickly becomes clear that this creates an unsustainable cycle if nothing is done almost all of the nations wealth will be in the hands of a few thousand families in a few generations
 
this threatens the very idea that america can continue as a meritocracy it makes a mockery of the notion that people earn what they are worth in the market or make money based on the amount of effort they are willing to put in it is clear that the idea that economic gains should go to those who deserve them is deeply threatened by this trend
 
it puts economic power into the hands of a small number of people who may have never worked and whole families who have never worked but whose investment decisions will have a significant effect on the nations future
 
ultimately it creates a selfperpetuating aristocracy that is lethal to democracy
 
it has been over 100 years since america last faced anything comparable to the concentration of wealth that has amassed today
 
back then president teddy roosevelt warned of a small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men whose chief object is to hold and increase their power who could destroy american democracy by disenfranchising working people
 
roosevelt had an answer to this challenge he taxed wealth following presidencies built on this idea the estate tax was enacted in 1916 and the capital gains tax in 1922
 
unfortunately since then both have been attacked and eroded as the rich have once again accumulated greater wealth and political power they have made use of that political power to push tax cuts for themselves
 
teddy roosevelt was a republican but trump and todays republican leaders clearly do not follow in his footsteps it seems unlikely that most democrats would go very far even if they had a chance big money has become too powerful in american politics one of the few voices speaking out against money in politics and who has consistently opposed the power of wealthy individuals and corporations to influence politics has been independent senator bernie sanders however democratic party leadership put obstacles in his way to their nomination and ultimately he was not successful
 
img srchttpi2cdncnncomcnnnextdamassets16060813531801berniesanders0608super169jpg
 
however something needs to be done taxing significant accumulated wealth is necessary if american democracy is ever to be repaired
 
maybe gary cohn is right when he says that only morons pay the estate tax however if he and his boss were smart and they cared about americas future they would realize the importance of decentralizing wealth roosevelts fear of an american dynasty may sadly be more relevant today than ever before

"__label__real mexico city reuters mexicos main automotive industry group said on monday us content in vehicles made south of the border is far higher than trump administration officials have argued as mexican auto output and exports posted robust growth in september
the comments came two days before trade negotiators from mexico the united states and canada meet for a fourth round of talks on revamping the north american free trade agreement nafta in washington
us president donald trump argues nafta has hollowed out american manufacturing in particular in automaking and fueled a us trade deficit in goods with mexico worth over 60 billion
he has threatened to ditch nafta if the deal cannot be reworked in favor of the united states
last month the trump administration released a study showing that us valueadded content was declining for manufactured goods imported from mexico and canada
the us commerce department analysis of oecd trade in valueadded data found us content in automotive imports from mexico fell to 181 percent in 2011 from 265 percent in 1995 us content in automotive imports from canada declined to 264 percent from 349 percent over the same period
however mexican auto industry association amia president eduardo solis told a news conference the figures did not tally with the groups own analysis which found that us content in mexican parts and components ranged between 37 percent and 395 percent depending on the scenario
in the case of canadian parts the us content varied from between 48 percent to 52 percent said solis who spoke at a news conference announcing the latest mexico output data
under nafta at least 625 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from north america to be able to enter the marketplace tarifffree
trump administration officials argue higher content requirements will bring back jobs to north america though privatesector lobbyists say excessively high minimum thresholds will hurt competitiveness and jeopardize jobs
solis himself will participate in the fiveday round of talks in washington beginning on wednesday
amia data published on monday showed mexican auto output rose by 77 percent to 307174 units last month compared with the same period a year earlier while exports surged 150 percent to 270899 vehicles threefourths of mexican auto exports are to the united states
the amia data showed mexican auto exports to europe surged in september by 3101 percent to 18117 units"
"__label__real but californians like many other americans chafed at border controls they deemed too lax the referendum passed by a margin of nearly 3 to 2 legal challenges stopped it in its tracks though a mortal blow was delivered when a federal judge in los angeles ruled in 1997 that the proposition was an unconstitutional legislative scheme to regulate immigration a sphere that judge said was solely the domain of the federal government
but even if it never took effect proposition 187 cast a long shadow similar measures enjoyed support in other states that were magnets for immigrants including arizona florida new york and texas gov pete wilson of california a republican who made the initiative a centerpiece of his 1994 reelection campaign described it as the twobyfour we need to get washington to pay heed to the flow of undocumented newcomers into the country

washington did pay attention in the mid1990s with republicans in control of congress and president clinton tacking more to the right tougher immigration policies took shape fences were built and patrols stepped up deportations rose they were scared to death of what prop 187 symbolized roberto suro a professor of public policy and journalism at the university of southern california and former new york times journalist told retro report the greater aggressiveness of the 1990s he said created the basis for the largescale removals that weve experienced in this country for the last 10 years those removals reached a peak under president barack obama described disapprovingly by some critics as the deporterinchief
now here is mr trump who built his presidential run on a promise to build a border wall and who began his campaign by attacking mexico as supposedly an exporter of rapists and other criminals as in 1994 california the anger is directed powerfully at those arriving without documentation last month though suggesting he was open to compromise the president announced he would end deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca the obamaera program that protected immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children
the trump assault however extends to all forms of immigration in august he embraced proposals to cut lawful entries in half over the next decade preference would be given to people possessing special skills and higher education hardly the tired the poor and the wretched refuse embraced in the new colossus the emma lazarus poem affixed to miss libertys base
two weeks ago trump administration officials disclosed their intention to cap refugee admissions at 45000 over the next year that would be the lowest ceiling by far since a 1980 law gave the president authority to help set limits on those searching for a haven from persecution in their own countries
surveys show that mr trumps america first sloganeering helped him eke out victories in november in critical swing states like michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin where some longerterm residents are uncomfortable with rising numbers of latino newcomers sudden diversity is rarely simple for some it is scary
advertisement continue reading the main story
but california in the wake of proposition 187 may point to where the country as a whole is headed the most populous state has undergone a profound demographic shift since the mid1990s latinos now have a plurality they and asianamericans combined are the majority nonhispanic whites account for less than 40 percent
as the video shows latinos in california are registering to vote in ever larger numbers though whites are still more likely to go to the polls the latino representation in the legislature grows as well to include prominent figures like state senator kevin de león he said that many californians and not just latinos have had enough with the scapegoating of certain ethnic groups whenever the state has economic or other troubles
now california is cerulean blue politically and there lies a cautionary tale for republicans with demographics changing almost everywhere they may yet find that the shortterm gain of the trump 2016 victory comes at their longterm expense
still dispelling xenophobia is no easy matter immigration is one of those touchy issues for americans that can suddenly turn ugly and flower into a major national argument that was from charles wheeler speaking in 1994 as executive director of the national center on immigrant rights what he said then remains true today"

"__label__real reuters about six in 10 people want british prime minister theresa may to remain in her position until the brexit process is completed an orb poll for the telegraph showed on monday
the poll carried out the weekend following mays speech to the conservative partys annual conference found that 57 percent of voters agreed that the prime minister should stay on at least until brexit negotiations are completed in march 2019
only one in five in a survey of more than 2000 voters thought that foreign secretary boris johnson would make a better replacement to may
mays bid to reassert her dwindling authority seemed to be stymied last week when her speech was interrupted by repeated coughing fits a prankster and even letters of her slogan falling off the set behind her
the speech comes just months after a june snap election saw her party lose its majority in parliament days before the opening of formal brexit talks with the european union

"__label__real they get into formula 1 early in japan lewis hamilton highfives a young fan while signing autographs at suzuka
lewis hamilton says he is not comfortable at all with his position in the championship despite a sizeable lead over rival sebastian vettel
the mercedes driver is 34 points ahead of vettel heading into sundays japanese grand prix with 125 available in the remaining five races this year
hamilton said i am under no illusion i might have the nail a little bit in but i need to keep hammering it
it is not done until there is no more to push it in
hamilton has gained 31 points on vettel in the past two races after problems for the german and his ferrari team
there are so many points available and you have seen other years where things swing hamilton added
the pendulum can swing i am hoping if it starts to swing the other way we have enough force to push it back to where it should be
ferrari have been quicker than mercedes in the past two races but both their cars crashed out together at the first corner in singapore and vettel finished fourth in malaysia after starting from the back because of an engine problem
asked to rate his chances of overhauling hamilton vettel said we have a chance i tend not to rate many things i think there is a chance and we make sure we use it
we are behind so it depends on what mercedes are doing we just have to do our best and we need to score much more than them how we achieve it doesnt matter as long as we do achieve it
lewis hamilton left has won three drivers world titles while sebastian vettel has four
if the car was perfect every weekend it would be boring
mercedes had a difficult weekend in malaysia where they expected to be more competitive than they were
hamilton said mercedes had definitely still question marks about the cars performance but added i saw some stories that we had been thrown off the ball or are on the back foot were not
we are still leading the championship we still have a great car each race is really just about trying to understand more about the car because there is constantly something new coming in the mix that can catch us off guard
that is the exciting thing about this car if the car was perfect every weekend it would be boring and we are enjoying the fact we are being challenged and that she is not the easiest
i dont know if any of you guys can predict but i definitely cant predict what races are going to work and what are not we thought wed be stronger in the last race but we were way off but we still got pole and finished second
the weather forecast for suzuka is for a wet day of practice on friday before drying up into the weekend"

in order to stop the threat of isis in southeast asia the us government must take measures to cut off isis access to firearms from the united states a few days ago reuters reported that the trump administration is preparing legislation that would make it easier for american gun manufacturers to sell weapons abroad aides are supposedly preparing to shift oversight of nonmilitary firearms from the state department to the commerce department this development is worrying because at present isis and other terror groups partially rely on usmade weapons to arm their members a major portion of isis growth in recent years has occurred in the philippines where it has become more active and caused chaos culminating in a recent attack on marawi one of the reasons it has done more damage is its ability to acquire more powerful weapons and deliver them to militias through its supply lines and this process is reliant on the groups ability to legally acquire usmade weapons making it easier to do so is not a good idea how isis spread into the philippines the island of mindanao which is in the southern philippines is where isis has made most of its moves

"__label__real stockholmlondon reuters a trio of swiss american and british scientists won the 2017 nobel chemistry prize on wednesday for developing cryoelectron microscopy allowing researchers to see biological molecules frozen in action
the work by jacques dubochet joachim frank and richard henderson makes it possible to image proteins and other molecules after freezing them rapidly to preserve their shape providing a powerful new tool for medical research
its like frames in a movie each of these pictures represents a frame and they can be put together into a movie and we can see what the molecules do said peter brzezinski a member of the nobel committee for chemistry
the new approach fills a previously blank space by generating images of everything from the surface of the zika virus to proteins that cause antibiotic resistance or are involved in alzheimers
the royal swedish academy of sciences which awarded the 9 million swedish crown 11 million prize said the technology had moved biochemistry into a new era
by freezing biomolecules midmovement scientists can unravel previously unseen processes a major advance both for basic understanding and the potential development of new drugs
scottishborn scientist henderson used an electron microscope to generate a threedimensional image of a protein at an atomic resolution showing the potential of the technology
until then electron microscopes were only seen as suitable for imaging dead matter because the powerful electron beam destroyed the biological material
his breakthrough was further developed by germanborn scientist frank a us citizen while dubochet of switzerland used rapidly frozen water to preserve the natural shape of the biomolecules
frank said cryoelectron microscopy had immense potential for medical research which is increasingly focused on processes inside cells but it would take time for this to play out and he was taken aback by news of the award
i was overwhelmed i thought the chances of winning a nobel prize were miniscule he told a news briefing by telephone
mapping disease
henderson was equally taken aback and said he had rejected the first phone call from the swedish academy on wednesday before picking up second time
molecular biologist and biophysicist richard henderson poses as he looks through a bacteriorhodopsin protein model following the announcement that he is a joint winner of the 2017 nobel prize in chemistry at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge britain october 4 2017 reuterstoby melville
the three of us who have been awarded the prize are sort of acting on behalf of the whole field he told a news conference in cambridge england
understanding the structure of proteins and working out how they interact in the body should spark fresh approaches to drug development just as earlier advances had produced todays multibilliondollar biotech drugs he added
in a few years maybe five years we might know most of the structures its quite an exciting time henderson said
indeed cryoelectron microscopy is already delivering results such as the recent discovery of the structure of tau protein filaments in alzheimers disease

it was also put to work last year in the fight against zika when the mosquitoborne virus was linked to an epidemic of braindamaged babies in brazil
as alarm about the outbreak spread scientists were able to generate threedimensional images of zika at the atomic level jumpstarting the search for potential drugs and vaccines
the use of these methods has completely revolutionized structural biology so everyone now wants to buy this type of equipment and start this type of research all over the world johan aqvist another nobel committee member told reuters
usbased thermo fisher scientific is a leading supplier of cryoelectron microscopy instruments
chemistry is the third of this years nobel prizes after the winners of the medicine and physics prizes were announced earlier this week
the prizes are named after alfred nobel the inventor of dynamite and have been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science literature and peace in accordance with his will
while the chemistry award has sometimes been overshadowed by the towering reputations of physics winners such as albert einstein laureates include groundbreaking scientists such as radioactivity pioneers ernest rutherford and marie curie though she also won the physics prize
the award passed over one of the highestprofile fields of research the socalled crisprcas9 gene editing technology that earlier this year allowed us scientists to alter genes in a human embryo to correct a diseasecausing mutation

this is not an easy week as we have four teams on bye and week 4 saw multiple running backs go down with injury while the options at the top of the rankings are as strong as ever it gets thin quick unless you are looking for value options in dfs it is going to be a week where you jump to the top of the list and pay the premium when it comes to seasonal leagues there isnt the same luxury and there will be some speculation involved lets take a look at how our options rank this week

notes
one of the worst injuries we saw this past sunday was chris carson going down with a broken ankle despite the loss seattles backfield is still pretty crowded but the rookie had taken the lead in the hierarchy i wouldnt read too much into the fact that thomas rawls was inactive last week as he doesnt contribute in any other areas of the game besides carrying the football following carsons injury pete carroll talked up rawls as his replacement even though he has just five carries for four yards so far this season eddie lacy will also be a factor he carried the ball 11 times for 52 yards last week but its worth taking a shot on rawls to see if he can recreate the magic from prior seasons cj prosise assuming he returns from his ankle injury will be a factor on passing downs but i wouldnt be surprised to see rawls take advantage of the rams 32nd ranked defense against opposing running backs
the cardinals lost their starting running back in week 1 and they are still looking to replace david johnson in reality they arent going to but as we enter week 5 andre ellington looks to be the closest option to do so arizona does have a tough matchup in philadelphia and their offense hasnt exactly been strong so far but ellington had himself quite a game last week he was targeted 14 times and caught nine passes for 86 yards while just missing a 12 yard touchdown as he stepped out of bounds in the past he has had success running the ball but last week he gained just 18 yards on five carries however it is not like chris johnson is doing that much better on the ground as he gained 32 yards on 13 carries at this pointellington is the back to own as at the very least he will get plenty of work in the passing game
just like that green bay is down to their number three running back in aaron jones while ty montgomery hasnt been officially ruled out with broken ribs im not expecting to see him out on the field in week 5 and joseph williams doesnt appear to be a factor thanks to his knee injury that brings us to jones who had success last week while making his nfl debut he had his share of success in college but his pro career consists of 13 carries for 49 yards and a touchdown green bay is a strong offense which should benefit jones as will facing dallas who has the 26th ranked fantasy defense against the run
another rookie running back who made his debut last week is wayne gallman unlike jones gallman is part of an offense and a team that is a complete mess while orleans darkwa was inactive due to a back injury gallman got his chance mainly thanks to the ineffectiveness of paul perkins the giants havent gotten much going on offense this season so it is likely that they will stick with gallman as long as it continues to work he gained 42 yards on 11 carries while catching another two passes for eight yards and finding the end zone with new yorks struggles on the offensive line gallmans running style is a better fit
the last two weeks houstons offense has come around and last week lamar miller was truly a part of that he found the end zone for the first time all season as he picked up both a rushing and receiving touchdown against the titans so far he has managed to hold off donta foreman and he is averaging 17 carries per game the problem is that while miller is getting the work he is averaging just 38 yards per carry it does work in his favor that the texans offense really seems to be getting on track with deshaun watson under center on a per carry basis foreman isnt much better than miller and the veterans dependability certainly has fantasy value
for the second straight week alex collins gained 82 yards on nine carries and it appears he has left terrance west in the dust collins also caught four passes for 32 yards but that doesnt mean we dont have questions he fumbled once again on sunday and this is not a new problem despite the fact that he led baltimore in carries collins was only on the field for 17 plays while buck allen saw 40 snaps allen carried the ball twice while catching six passes for 37 yards that appears to be the ceiling for allen while if baltimore and collins can get past the fumbles he could get into double digits carrying the ball there is some value in that especially this week depending on your situation

"__label__fake buy em or deny em is now the time to move on from mike gilislee
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
the assumption was that mike gillislee would step into the legarrette blount role for the patriots meaning an opportunity would be there to be a force on a weekly basis blount thrived in new england last season racking up 1161 yards and 18 td and after two weeks it looked like gillislee could put up a similar line
first two games 33 carries 114 yards 4 td
hes continued to see carries in the subsequent three games with 12 carries per contest but the results have not been impressive
next three games 36 carries 132 yards 0 td
the carries have been down and there could be a variety of reasons ie game flow but the bigger issue is that the numbers demonstrate how td dependent he is even over those first two games when he was averaging a few more carries 165 carries per game without the td he wouldve been a worthless fantasy play
overall hes averaging 36 yardscarry and theres a chance that the opportunities start to diminish dion lewis outgained gillislee in week 5 with 53 yards on just 7 carries over the past two weeks he has 71 yards and 1 td on 11 carries 65 yardscarry after getting 8 carries over the first three weeks of the season
its easy to forget that when on the field lewis has been a productive runner for new england over the past two seasons he was limited to 14 games but he totaled 113 carries and 517 yards 46 yardscarry maybe hes capped at 810 touches per game as a way to keep him healthy but those touches will come at the expense of gillislee
weve long been skeptical about new england as you never truly know what they are going to do on a weekly basis of course given lewis history theres always the risk that he goes down and misses time and that will give gilislee a little bit more value once again for now hes going to remain a td dependent flex play and that means you can only utilize him if you are desperate
as far as targeting him in a trade its hard to consider him a buy low candidate in fact if you can still deal him for a premium wed be far more likely to cut bait and trade him as opposed to letting him take up a spot at the back of your roster and never being willing to put him in an active role

"__label__fake jets vs jaguars week 4 preview
before its news
coming off of what may have been the best performance todd bowles has gotten out of his team since taking over in a 206 win over the miami dolphins the jets host the jacksonville jaguars the jets may have a hard time dominating on defense the way they did against jay cutler and the dolphins last week saw the jaguars throttle the baltimore ravens 447 as quarterback blake bortles threw 4 touchdown passes in a game that he was forced to exit early
who ny jets 12 vs jacksonville jaguars 21
when sunday at 1 pm
where metlife stadium
point spread jets 3
heres a look at which players and position groups will be key for the jets this sunday at home
ilb darron lee vs te mercedes lewis
lewis is coming off of a 3 touchdown performance against the baltimore ravens and the ravens have to know that darron lee has been vulnerable in coverage blake bortles could view the matchup as an opportunity to stay with the hat hand in lewis and look his way when the ravens are in the red zone
jets dline vs rb leonard fournette
fournette is only averaging around 35 yards per carry but the battering ram running back will test the jets defensive line and linebackers early on if they dont find a way to keep him in check the jaguars will likely give the jets a big dose of the heavy hitter if the jets defense gets gassed early the jags could also turn to former jets rb chris ivory whose fresh legs and physical style could set him up for a big day as well
leonard williams is still in search of his first sack of the season
dl leonard williams vs lt cam robinson
the jets like to move their defensive linemen around in multiple looks and williams while nursing a sore wrist is still looking for his first sack of the season robinson a rookie out of alabama should give williams now in his third year an opportunity to make some impact plays on defense
wr robby anderson vs cb aj bouye
bouye has been a big reason for jacksonvilles improved defense and robby anderson was a key factor in the jets offense getting going last week against the dolphins andersons 69yard touchdown pass was the teams offensive highlight of the day look for quarterback josh mccown to take a couple of deep shots down the field to anderson who has had success in beating some of the leagues best cornerbacks since last season
rbs bilal powell and elijah mcguire vs mlb paul posluszny
matt forte is on the shelf for this one with a bout of turf toe so jets fans will get their wish and see a heavy dose of bilal powell and rookie running back elijah mcguire both powell and mcguire do an excellent job of finding a hole if its there and finding their way through it when they do it will be poslusznys job to limit the damage at the second level
rt ben ijalanabrent qvale vs olb dante fowler
brandon shell has been listed as doubtful in this one and that will likely mean ijalana or qvale will take his place if so fowler will likely be moved around a fair bit and get his chance to make some plays against a pair of tackles who are adequate at best josh mccown has been solid for gang green in the early going and jacksonville would like nothing more than to disrupt his timing with some heavy blitz packages
the jets will be hoping for a better turnout than they saw last week but in all reality its going to take more than a win or two to convince the fan base that this team is worth making the trek for and sundays game probably wont help
prediction
jaguars 27 jets 17

"__label__real tanzina vega covers race and inequality for cnn money and is currently on leave as a ferris professor of journalism at princeton university follow her on twitter tanzinavega the opinions expressed in this commentary are her own
cnn as americans watched the devastation unfolding in puerto rico last week i read listened tweeted and posted information on my social media timelines then came the text bubbles on my cell phone screen
is your family ok they asked
im praying for you they said
i felt conflicted about how to respond in some ways things are okay the few immediate family members i have on the island are alive some rode out the storm from the mainland and are trying to return to their communities to assess the wreckage that awaits for many puerto ricans on the island and in the larger diaspora however we have a long way to go before ever getting back to okay
the islands status as a united states territory and by extension its peculiar and colonial relationship with the united states has been exposed to the rest of the world like the roots of the trees left bare from the force of marias winds and rain in a blistering public statement a group of puerto rican intellectuals and activists said the world has found out in the past few days what our history has always stubbornly made visible to us
the effects of hurricane maria will force some residents to leave the island and their homes behind the ongoing fiscal crisis has already precipitated a massive loss of talent on the island we could be on the precipice of yet another great migration to the mainland with many puerto ricans settling throughout the united states the crisis could also signal a new political awakening among puerto ricans eager to examine the colonial status of the island and prevent further economic and cultural erosion
the island is now bracing for its own major reconstruction whose cultural economic and and psychosocial effects will take years to unravel
puerto ricans have always had an imbalanced relationship in the united states a permanent state of yes but no we are united states citizens by birth but those who live on the island have limited rights they cannot vote for president and have no vote in congress antiquated policies like the jones act which require all goods ferried between us ports to be carried on ships built owned and operated by americans have further hurt the islands economy
im a national reporter at cnn on a teaching fellowship at princeton but i am also a puerto rican woman from new york a nuyorican a boricua i spent half of my childhood visiting my family on the island in many of the towns that have been decimated by hurricane maria including utuado and arecibo generations of my family have lived and died on the island many of my generation grew up listening to tales of the radical young lords party of the 1970s swinging to our parents old salsa records and creating icons of our own including sonia sotomayor jennifer lopez ricky martin and lin manuel miranda i took for granted that the puerto rico i knew would always exist like my grandparents i assumed that one day i would be able to return and have my own small piece of paradise
after maria a harrowing report in the washington post described utuado where my fathers side of the family is from as a prison with residents trapped by mudslides impassable roads and little to no food drinking water or power
nestled deep in the lush mountains of puerto ricos cordillera central it used to take hours of navigating curving twisted roads to reach utudao i know the trip well i made it almost every time i visited puerto rico as part of the annual island pilgrimage many mainlanders made to visit our abuelos our tios and our primos it was that deceptively simple fluidity of movement from the island to the mainland and back that helped create the bicultural and transmigratory ties many puerto ricans still have to the island
the response to maria could also make more puerto ricans politically engaged than they have been in the past its a call to action for puerto ricans in the diaspora that we all have to get to the polls and make sure that if our island counterparts cant have their voice heard during elections that we vote on their behalf said elizabeth aranda a sociology professor at the university of south florida and author of the book emotional bridges to puerto rico what affects them on the island affects us
puerto ricans have paid their dues even though people think that havent aranda also observed they have been paying taxes they pay higher prices for consumer items they are the testing ground for all sorts of experiments indeed puerto rican women in particular have been used to testing pharmaceutical products from birth control to opioids like oxycontin
los angeles times investigation found that the first patients to use the drug were women recuperating from abdominal and gynecological surgery at two hospitals in puerto rico in 1989
president trump during his visit to the island this week tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd and callously remarked on how few people had died and how much recovery efforts would cost the united states he added to the pain that many puerto ricans are feeling in a way that aranda described as a form of symbolic violence many puerto ricans may be asking themselves is this really my country
today the united states is experiencing a wave of calls for racial and social justice in a way that we havent seen in decades puerto ricans who are black white and brown are not exempt from that discussion in addition to the symbolic violence we are experiencing postmaria we too have been impacted by mass incarceration police brutality racial profiling and unfair socioeconomic policies
the summers i spent in puerto rico were one of the brightest parts of my childhood they were an escape from the pressures many of us experienced living on the mainland instead of being surrounded by red brick public housing buildings i would rock back and forth on the hammock my grandparents in barceloneta had hung on the balcony of their home reading and watching the trees bend in the breeze i woke up to the sound of a roosters crow as chickens clucked in the gravel and dirt yard lemons grew on a tree in front of the house my grandfather would pluck them one by one gingerly slicing and squeezing them to make juice my cousins and i ran around in plastic chancletas tshirts and shorts and ate homemade ice pops those summer breaks were a respite of nature and love

when my grandfather in utuado died i was about a year into my first reporting job at the new york times at the top of those mountains i delivered an impromptu eulogy as raindrops gently tapped the dark green awning covering his casket and our small group of mourners
i had spent the day before the funeral cleaning out drawers in his bedroom and had found various files he kept for decades including a certificate from when he studied english during night classes at the local high school in new york city and receipts for classes on how to repair washing machines and other household appliances he even did a short stint as a busboy in the new york times cafeteria even though his english was still not advanced enough to read the paper he would occasionally take a copy home for his cousin to read when he died i placed a copy of the paper with a frontpage story i had written in the casket we made it abuelo i said

floridas supreme court has ruled that police may detain passengers any and all passengers during even minor traffic stops and that doing so does not violate constitutional rights to hold someone not suspected of any wrongdoing for a reasonable time the newspaper reported
the high court made the ruling after evaluating a january 29 2015 traffic stop in which a car with a broken tail light was pulled over in gainesville for allegedly rolling through a stop sign gregory presley was one of two passengers in the stopped vehicle questioned by officer john pandak about who he was and where they were going the officer asked if any of the passengers had been drinking and presley questioned why would that be a problem
i dont know man officer pandak replied this is a traffic stop youre part of it so were hanging out thats all there is to it well were just talking man you cant go anywhere at the moment because youre part of this stop thats all
it turns out after running the records of presley the police officer found out that he was 0n probation for alcohol presley was arrested and taken to jail at trial presley argued that the stop violated his fourth amendment rights protection from unreasonable searches and seizures and tried to suppress the evidence against him gained in what he called an illegal detention
floridas appellate courts were split on the question so the high court stepped in to resolve the issue the justices agreed with prosecutors that an officers safety trumps a passengers rights
the intrusion upon personal liberty is de minimis because the method of transport has already been lawfully interrupted by virtue of the stop the passenger has already been stopped by virtue of the drivers lawful detention and routine traffic stops are brief in duration chief justice jorge labarga wrote for the court
the court added that a passenger of a vehicle cannot be detained any longer than the amount of time it takes to check the drivers license and write a ticket unless there is a reason to suspect the passenger is involved in any wrongdoing
detention is permissible for this limited period of time because it allows law enforcement officers to safely do their job accomplishing the mission of the stop and not be at risk due to potential violence from passengers or other vehicles on the roadway justice larbarga said
another justice barbara j pariente agreed with the other judges on the landmark decision but she noted that this was a case in which a black man was interrogated in his neighborhood in the morning against his will
when the traffic stop does not give rise to a need to question passengers or ask for their identification i fail to comprehend why the interrogation of passengers on matters unrelated to the traffic stop so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop does not intrude on the constitutional guarantee to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures she wrote
the justices declined to address whether or not the new law would affect transportation businesses such as buses and taxis if a driver was pulled over for a minor traffic violation in its current state this ruling theoretically would allow a police officer to detain an entire bus load of people against their will
in reaching this holding we expressly decline to address whether law enforcement may detain passengers during a traffic stop of a common carrier or a vehicle that at the time of the stop is being utilized as part of a transportationbased business justice labarga noted

"__label__real the demands were developed by a halfdozen agencies and departments officials said but among the officials behind the demands are stephen miller the presidents top policy adviser and attorney general jeff sessions both of whom have long advocated extremely aggressive efforts to prevent illegal entry into the country and crack down on undocumented immigrants already here
the demands represented a concerted effort to broaden the expected congressional debate about the dreamers to one about overhauling the entire american immigration system on terms that hardline conservatives have been pursuing for decades
in a letter to lawmakers mr trump said his demands would address dangerous loopholes outdated laws and easily exploited vulnerabilities in the immigration system asserting that they were reforms that must be included in any deal to address the dreamers
democratic leaders in congress reacted with alarm saying the demands threaten to undermine the presidents own statements in which he had pledged to work across the aisle to protect the dreamers through legislation
video
the administration cant be serious about compromise or helping the dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the dreamers to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of americans senator chuck schumer of new york and representative nancy pelosi of california the democratic leaders in the senate and the house said in a joint statement
mr schumer and ms pelosi who declared after a white house dinner last month that they had reached a deal with mr trump to protect dreamers denounced the presidents demands as failing to represent any attempt at compromise they called it little more than a thinly veiled effort to scuttle negotiations even before they begin in earnest
if the president was serious about protecting the dreamers his staff has not made a goodfaith effort to do so they added

last month the president abruptly ended an obamaera policy called deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca in which former president barack obama had used his executive authority to protect about 800000 of the young immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide them work permits
even as mr trump kept his campaign promise to halt what he had described as one of the most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president he quickly added that he would work with democrats in congress to replace the executive policy with legislation giving them six months to do so but a white house official said on sunday that mr trump was not open to a deal that would eventually allow the dreamers to become united states citizens
the presidents position has been that hes called on congress to come up with a permanent solution and a fix to this process sarah huckabee sanders the white house press secretary said last week
immigration advocates will most likely urge democratic leaders to refuse a deal that includes the presidents proposals but immigration and human rights advocates are also under pressure to do something for the dreamers thousands of whom will begin by march losing permission to work and protection from deportation if a deal is not reached
privately many advocates have acknowledged that a negotiated deal with the republican president is likely to include some immigration changes
administration officials responsible for securing the border and enforcing the nations immigration laws told reporters on sunday night that the changes requested by the president were essential to protecting american workers from unfair competition and deterring what they described as a neverending flow of illegal immigrants into the country
on the presidents wish list is a longsought republican goal of stopping american residents from sponsoring the arrival of extended family members his demand would limit residents to bringing only spouses and children

also central to the effort officials said are legal changes that would strip away the rights of illegal immigrants to claim asylum or make another case to stay in the united states allowing federal officials to more quickly deport them
advertisement continue reading the main story
we cannot have true border security if we dont change federal laws to ensure that people who are apprehended are removed said ron vitiello the acting deputy commissioner for customs and border protection
thomas d homan the acting director of immigration and customs enforcement said a vast increase in the number of agents and other federal resources would allow for a crackdown on immigration violators that had been difficult in the past
another key part of that crackdown would be on tens of thousands of children who have surged across the border with mexico during the past several years many of them seeking to escape gangrelated violence in central american countries this year about 38500 children have been apprehended at the border without their parents
administration officials say the children many of whom are sent to live with a cousin aunt uncle or sibling in the united states must be turned back or quickly deported once they arrive under current law many of them remain in the united states for years during legal proceedings to evaluate their asylum or refugee claims
if the children are not deported quickly officials say many will never leave eventually becoming a new population of sympathetic young immigrants who seek amnesty that could create lasting cycles in which illegal immigrants demand to be given a legal status the officials say
the presidents demands include new rules that say children are not considered unaccompanied at the border if they have a parent or guardian in the united states they also propose treating children from central america the same way they do children from mexico who can be repatriated more quickly with fewer rights to hearings
mr trump is also calling for a surge in resources to pay for 370 additional immigration judges 1000 government lawyers and more detention space so that children arriving at the border can be held processed and quickly returned if they do not qualify to stay longer
critics say the focus on deporting unaccompanied children is heartless and impractical they say many were sent by their parents on long dangerous treks in the hopes of avoiding poverty hunger abuse or death by gangs in their home countries
advocates acknowledge that more resources are necessary to speed up those hearings but they argue that white house efforts to demand quick decisions are likely to merely result in many children being sent back to places where they are raped beaten or killed

moscow reuters russia is within its rights to restrict the operations of us media organizations in russia in retaliation for what moscow calls us pressure on a kremlinbacked tv station a russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said on sunday
russian officials have accused washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the us operations of rt a kremlinfunded broadcaster accused by some in washington of interfering in domestic us politics which it denies
the foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said the full weight of the us authorities was being brought to bear against rts operations in the united states and that moscow had the right to respond
we have never used russian law in relation to foreign correspondents as a lever of pressure or censorship or some kind of political influence never zakharova said in an interview with russias ntv broadcaster but this is a particular case
she cited a 1991 russian law which she said stated that if a russian media outlet is subject to restrictions in a foreign country then moscow has the right to impose proportionate restrictions on media outlets from that country operating inside russia
correspondingly everything that russian journalists and the rt station are subject to on us soil after we qualified it as restriction of their activities we can apply similar measures to american journalists american media here on russian territory zakharova said
she did not identify any specific us media outlets that would be targeted she said it made no difference from the russian governments point of view if those outlets were backed by the us state or privatelyfunded
late last month russias state communications regulator accused us tv channel cnn international of violating its license to broadcast in russia and said it had summoned the broadcasters representatives in connection with the matter
the watchdog did not publicly disclose the nature of the violation the head of the regulator said it was a technical matter and denied that politics was involved
us intelligence officials in a report in january this year into allegations of russian interference in the us presidential election said rt was part of a staterun propaganda machine that supported a kremlin campaign to influence us politics
russia today and russian officials have denied any attempt to interfere in us politics they say that political forces in the united states are whipping up hysteria about russias influence to discredit president donald trump

"__label__fake preseasonblackhawks at boston42 loss recap
before its news
the blackhawks sent their kid squad to boston to face the bruins monday night most of the regulars were left back in south bend and it showed the only regular players that were in this game were brandon saad connor murphy and corey crawford that should tell you some things right off the bat not only that but the roster listed luke johnson as 82 and playing defense jordan oesterle gets no respect its preseason for everyone i suppose
if not for the final minute the first period was a complete disaster the hawks gave up two goals on the first handful of shots and then later gave up a third goal before they were able to stop the bleeding
the second period couldnt have possibly been any worse so there was only one way to go up the hawks were able to hold the bruins off the board while scoring a goal to bring the game back within one goal
in the third period the blackhawks gave up a powerplay goal that put the game out of reach and much like saturday night they didnt have enough time to complete the comeback not a terrible showing for the blackhawks but certainly not an overly impressive one either lets hope we get to see more regulars in the final two preseason games
the good
brandon saad was able to cut the lead to just 2 goals with under a minute remaining in the first period cody franson hit erik gustafsson across the ice gustafsson then turned and saw brandon saad just about 5 feet to malcolm subbans right wisely hitting saads tape with a pass which was redirected by saad off subban and into the net
midway through the second period a gassed jordan oesterle desperately flicked the puck up to tanner kero even though the pass was behind him kero was able to corral the puck and make a slick pass to the streaking john hayden hayden drove hard to the net
protecting the puck and beat subban the puck hit the back post and was originally waved off but the war room in toronto signalled the horn and ruled the play a good goal
protecting the puck and beat subban the puck hit the back post and was originally waved off but the war room in toronto signalled the horn and ruled the play a good goal for the second game in a row the blackhawks were pretty good at the faceoff dots winning 58
the bad
corey crawford only saw 23 shots and gave up 4 goals thank god it is preseason
the golden child debrincat had his time to shine and was virtually invisible three shots on net and no points if i didnt know he was on the roster for the game i might have even doubted that he played
the ugly
under a minute into the game on the first shot on net david pastrnak caught corey crawford deep in his net and pastrnak ate him up from a sharp angle
thirty six seconds after the pastrnak goal defenseman jeremy lasuzon flipped an innocent dump in shot towards corey crawford and crawford just flubbed it if you thought the first goal was bad this one was even worse
about 8 minutes later the veteran bruins caught gustav forsling hanging onto the puck too long and trying to stickhandle with one hand on his stick right up the gut in his own zone marchand and bergeron stripped him and the late forward anders bjork was the lucky recipient of a backdoor tap in goal

"__label__real washington appears to be moving closer to new gun rules
on capitol hill support appeared to grow for a ban on the bump stock devices either through regulation or legislation as republicans who for decades have rejected any form of gun restrictions began increasingly to speak out several leading republicans including senator john cornyn the no 2 republican in the senate have raised serious questions about the devices
in the house representative carlos curbelo republican of florida has drafted a measure banning bump stocks which he said he planned to introduce on thursday he said his office had been flooded with calls from dozens of fellow republicans who wanted to sign on
i think we are on the verge of a breakthrough when it comes to sensible gun policy mr curbelo said
his comments followed those of house speaker paul d ryan who during an interview with msnbc also raised questions about the conversion kits and said he was open to legislation clearly thats something we need to look into mr ryan said
separately representative adam kinzinger republican of illinois is circulating a letter among his colleagues calling on the atf to reevaluate bump stocks which he said have no place in civilized society
the fire chief wondered are we under a mumbaistyle attack
chief greg cassell of the clark county fire department said on thursday that several factors complicated the departments response to the mass shooting but he praised the emergency responders as heroic
we had a lot of challenges with this event mr cassell said at a news conference wounded concertgoers fled to various hotels and called 911 from there he said by the time it got relayed it was theres a shooter at this location he said it was people were shot
typically all 911 calls from a single event would be linked he said but because of the confusion on sunday night operators logged the calls as coming from 32 separate incidents each of which needed to be investigated mr cassell said they wondered are we under a mumbaistyle attack where weve got multiple things going on at multiple properties
he was referring to a group of coordinated terror attacks in mumbai india in november 2008 when gunmen stormed two hotels a railroad station a restaurant a hospital and a jewish center 160 people were killed

mr cassell said that as crews were heading to the concert area in las vegas they encountered injured people in every direction so they stopped aided those patients and called for more help rather than continuing on to the site of the shooting
he said a total of 160 members of local fire departments responded to the emergency only one was hurt suffering a minor injury from a fall
weve been somewhat planning on a major event in our valley for an awful awful long time along these lines he said we never planned on what happened the other night
the gunmans girlfriend said she was unaware of the plan
in her first public statement since the shooting the gunmans girlfriend said on wednesday that he had sent her on a trip to the philippines and wired her money there but that she did not know he had been planning to harm anyone
the statement from the woman marilou danley which was read by her lawyer matthew lombard came after ms danley went to the los angeles offices of the fbi for questioning according to a law enforcement official it was released as the authorities sought her insight into what prompted a man with no evident criminal history to become a mass murderer
she stressed that she returned to the united states voluntarily because i know that the fbi and the las vegas police department wanted to talk to me and i wanted to talk to them
ms danley said she never believed her kind caring quiet boyfriend was capable of killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more
he never said anything to me or took any action that i was aware of that i understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen she said
the gunman booked accommodations near another festival
the gunmans motive remains unknown sheriff lombardo said on wednesday despite the meticulous planning that went into the attack the gunman left behind few obvious traces with no social media footprint to examine or manifesto to be pored over he said
the sheriff indicated that mr paddock may have blended in intentionally hiding the urge to violence that drove him to one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern united states history
anything that would indicate this individuals trigger point that would cause him to do such harm we havent understood it yet the sheriff said dont you think the concealment of his history of his life was wellthoughtout
investigators continue to piece together the life and mindset of a gunman who had no apparent prior history of violence what we know is stephen paddock is a man who spent decades acquiring weapons and ammo and living a secret life much of which will never be fully understood the sheriff said
mr lombardo said that a few days before the shooting the gunman took another set of rooms in a highrise building near another music festival through airbnb he rented a unit in the ogden a condominium building in downtown las vegas with a view of the life is beautiful festival held from sept 22 to sept 25

"__label__real rory mcilroy posted a levelpar 72 in the final round at dunhill links
rory mcilroy has chosen to hit the pause button rather than his driver for the next few weeks and it may prove the most important decision of his career
it is most likely we will not see him again in competitive action until the abu dhabi championship in january
the 28yearolds mediocre winless 2017 season came to a selfdetermined and muted end at the dunhill links championship on sunday where he finished up sharing a miserable 63rd place
it concluded a campaign where the northern irishman was eclipsed by a new generation of young talent he knows it too and this is another reason for the break he is just starting
for the rest of this year he will lay foundations for what he expects to be the second half of his career
the initial objective is to get healthy enough to allow for prolonged range time this is because like the former world number ones body his golf game has also been off colour for far too long
in recent years mcilroy has not made the most of his prodigious talents having failed to add to the four majors he collected by the end of august 2014
the following summer was ruined by a freak football injury immediately before his intended open defence and since then there have been no further steps towards his stated ambition of 10 major titles
mcilroy wants to overtake gary players total of nine to become the games most successful nonamerican golfer but 2017 offered little evidence to suggest such a lofty ambition is attainable
with his year seriously undermined by a rib problem mcilroy managed to play in only 18 tournaments there were seven top10s in a campaign that included two runnerup finishes
2014 open champion mcilroy ended on five under par at royal birkdale this year but was still seven shots behind winner jordan spieth
mcilroys share of fourth place at the open where he was always playing catchup after falling five over par after only six holes was his best showing at the majors
i dont think any year is a wasted year mcilroy told bbc sport ive learned a lot this year in terms of how i manage myself manage my schedule and how i practise
it hasnt been what ive wanted in terms of results but it is not as though i have missed a ton of cuts
mcilroy is convinced the debilitating rib injury which first surfaced while finishing second in last januarys south african open is the prime reason for his lack of 2017 victories
now is the time to completely cure himself of its niggling effects there will be long periods spent in the gym and doing rehabilitation work that will ultimately allow him to spend more time on the range
i will have six intensive weeks over novemberdecember time where i will be getting my body right mcilroy told me
but i think as well i will be mentally in a better place
its been tough because physically i havent been where i have needed to be and wanted to be this year
and that takes its toll mentally because you feel like you are trying to prepare and trying to practise but you just cant quite
i havent felt 100 totally prepared any week that ive played because of the injury
it is clear that mcilroy is fed up with mediocrity with being unable to capitalise on still possessing arguably the finest natural talents in the game
there has been an air of resignation around the northern irishman blissfully happy off the course the newlywed has lacked the same mojo inside the ropes
justin thomas won the pga championship while fellow american brooks koepka secured the us open title in 2017
and at the same time the competition has deepened americans justin thomas 24 and brooks koepka 27 are both younger than mcilroy and each became a major champion in 2017
jordan spieth is only 24 and his open win in july took the american to three majors just one behind world number six mcilroy
the landscape of the game has changed a bit since i started to win majors mcilroy told reporters at st andrews
youve got young hungry guys now who are fearless and they are playing the game how i basically came out and played a few years ago
its just about trying to gain an advantage here or there so just reassessing everything and making sure im not leaving any stone unturned and do everything i can to get back to being the best player in the world
mcilroy feels he is a better player than the one who youthfully collected his initial major titles in 2011 and 2012 he spent 95 weeks of his first decade on tour as world number one
i see no reason why i cant better that in the next 10 years and thats why i feel like these three months are very important for me to put some really good things in place he said
mcilroy also has to decide on who will be the longterm caddie replacement for jp fitzgerald with whom he split after the open in july
he has to decide whether having his best friend harry diamond is the best option reports have suggested he may turn to joe lacava the rather underworked caddie of tiger woods
harry diamond mcilroys childhood best friend first worked with the fourtime major winner at the wgcbridgestone invitational
certainly someone alongside mcilroy with the course management skills to make the most of the players substantial golfing gifts would seem a sensible move
in the competitive landscape he needs all the help he can get
but mcilroy remains bullish about his chances im still confident that i have the ability to do it he said
the quality of golf out there now has not got any worse its only got better
but you know ive been able to win tournaments against the best players in the world and playing at their best and feel confident that ill be able to do that again
what happens over the coming weeks may well determine the success of the second decade of his career
one thing is for certain mcilroy has had enough of trying to play catchup there is a career grand slam to complete he only needs the masters a fifth ryder cup on the horizon and surging movement of golfing youth to be tamed
with a confident smile he told me i actually feel like im getting a headstart on everyone else which will be a nice position to be in"

for descriptive personal insights integrated with intimate comedy check out i mom so hard a series of short videos by two los angeles improv comedians kristin hensley and jen smedley that has taken off in popularity regularly earning hundreds of thousands of views and is being adapted for a cbs show
in the videos these chatty moms with traces of a midwestern accent riff on a theme mom friends sleep spanx in the choppy editing style favored by youtube stars like grace helbig that turns a conversation into a highlight reel of jokes and quips its slickly produced but since they shoot in a real house and have obvious chemistry finishing each others sentences it feels casual even offhand
these performers can get off a good rant about dumb advice and expectations whoever said kids dont need anything but love has not met a kid they need whatevers on the tv right then but they are particularly good at zeroing in on overlooked anxietyproducing moments like the financial calculus of whether date night is worth it factoring in babysitting rates and how youre feeling about your husband at the moment or the tricky challenge of finding the right mom friend

i seek out someone with the same level of dysfunction says ms smedley whose humor is cutting and sly her partner has a broader aesthetic the female version of dad humor i need someone who looks like they were just crying and are now putting on a brave face
this theme of friendship provides the subtext for the series because while the stars of i mom so hard go as dark as the other comics the way these two women work together setting each other up and clashing goodnaturedly provides an unexpected argument for the benefit of having children you make friendships built to last
it is notable that none of these comics criticize their kids that harshly or directly is this more of a taboo for a mother than a father if so its one that i predict a female comic will break to the same success that louis c k did with his comic insults about his children comedy like horror gravitates toward the unspoken and repressed
and to capture the real experience of being a parent you cant overlook kvetching about your own kids sure not all parents go there but the funny ones do"

according to police the guard was investigating an alarm that went off in another room on the same floor when he heard a drilling sound from paddocks room
the gunman inserted spy cameras into the peep hole on the door of his suite police have previously said
clark county sheriff joseph lombardo also amended the date on which police believe paddock checked into mandalay bay
media playback is unsupported on your device media caption police officers who entered the las vegas gunmans hotel room describe what they saw
they initially said he had checked in on 28 september three days before the shooting
they now say he checked in on 25 september
paddock sprayed gunfire from the upper floors of the mandalay bay hotel on to a concert attended by thousands of people
some things were bound to change
sheriff lombardo said that police did not realise that the security guard had been shot until they arrived on the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay hotel
that was the case even though the guard managed to alert the hotels security team
mr lombardo said new information had emerged during the investigation and that some things were bound to change given its complicated nature
police also say that the gunman 64 was seen on numerous occasions in las vegas gambling heavily by himself the night before the shooting which ended with him killing himself
paddock was dead by the time officers entered the room and it is not known why he had stopped shooting
this individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event and it is difficult for us to find the answers mr lombardo told a news conference paddocks motives remain unclear
extensive research into the gunmans mental state found no explanation for such a violent turn of events police say
it is suspected paddock scouted out other locations near openair concerts in the weeks before the las vegas attack"

headlines and commentary across both eastern and western media have mainly focused on the catalan independence referendum and the actions of spanish police and the spanish governments attempts to disrupt polls
however little is being said about what the real implications of catalan independence may be what do those politicians in catalonia in favor of independence seek to do with it should they succeed will they create a catalonia that serves the best interests of the people or serve the eu and nato more efficiently and eagerly than a united spain ever could
there are 5 points those following this conflict should know and keep in mind as events unfold
1 catalonia has a formidable industrialized economy relative to other regions of spain with a gdp and population just exceeding those of nations like scotland or singapore and likely could achieve and sustain independence from spain
2 nato appears eager to encourage independence and would welcome what they expect to be a robust military capability to add to their wars of global aggression
an article published in 2014 by the atlantic council a fortune 500funded nato think tank titled the military implications of scottish and catalonian secession would state
catalonia has 73 million people with more than 300 billion in gdp spending just 16 of that on defense provides over 45 billion annually or roughly the budget of denmark which has wellregarded and efficient armed forces catalonian military plans are more vague but so far they emphasize the navy with excellent ports in barcelona and tarragona catalonia is wellpositioned as a minor naval power with the mediterranean as our strategic environment and nato as our framework as the nationalists thinktank on defense argues the rough plans call for a littoral security group of a few hundred sailors at first after a few years catalonia would assume responsibility as a main actor in the mediterranean with landbased maritime patrol aircraft and small surface combatants eventually the nationalist ambition may include an expeditionary group with a light assault carrier and hundreds of marines to take a serious role in collective security
the atlantic council piece would emphatically conclude that
if accurately characterized by the few white papers that have surfaced the separatists position suggests a valuable and refreshing view of specialization in collective defense build a navy that is comparatively focused on influencing events ashore
3 proindependence catalan politicians appear to enthusiastically support catalonias membership in nato
when the next afghanistan comes catalan blood will also be spilled
a 2014 article titled catalan pm confirms nato membership commitment to collective security stated
prime minister artur mas explicitly confirmed catalonia is seeking nato membership in a recent interview with the italian daily la reppublica catalan prime minister artur mas explained that an independent catalonia sees herself at the heart of nato this is in line with catalonias commitment to the international community the principle of collective security international law and the rule of law at sea
the article also claims
catalonia seeks freedom not to avoid the inescapable responsibilities that come hand in hand with it but to fully exercise them side by side with partners and allies catalans understand fully that freedom never comes without cost and that whereas independence means government of the people by the people and for the people instead of alien rule it also means that they will not be able to look the other way when a crisis or challenge arises they understand that when the next afghanistan comes catalan blood will also be spilled
in essence catalan politicians appear eagerly committed not only to nato but to the foreign wars of aggression it wages and spilling the blood of its people to help nato fight them
4 some catalan politicians have begun planning for its militarys integration into nato
the proindependence catalan national assemblys defense policy working group has stated in a 2014 paper titled dimensions of the catalan defence forces naval forces executive summary that
the mediterranean our strategic environment nato our framework free stormproof waterproof survival match kit ad catalonia must participate in snmg2 standing nato maritime group 2 formerly standing naval force mediterranean a component of the nrf nato response force it would also be convenient to participate in the snmcmg2 standing nato mine countermeasures group 2
5 like kurdistan any sort of independence is meaningless if the resulting state finds itself utterly dependent and entwined with western hegemony and the institutions that maintain it especially at the cost of member states and proxies be they kurdish or catalan
that catalonias politicians have already openly and eagerly pledged catalan blood and treasure to foreign interests and the wars they seek to fight across the globe suggests that the notion of catalonia actually achieving any sort of independence is actually catalonia simply becoming more dependent on an even greater master and one even further abroad
further thoughts
these 5 points should be considered by those for and against catalan independence while catalonia could create for itself a lasting and meaningful independence underpinned by peace and prosperity for its people it appears that many in senior leadership positions intend to simply shift catalonias subservience from madrid to brussels
further questions regarding catalonias economy remain including what an independent catalonia might do to help feed larger foreign corporations who may seek to circumvent barriers and obstacles in spains current economic climate and exploit an independent catalonia its people markets and resources unfortunately such economic policies and their fallout may unfold long after it is possible for the people of catalonia to do anything about it
for the catalan people dedicated to independence they must find and use the local socioeconomic leverage necessary to direct their potentially independent nation toward a trajectory that best serves them and their future not a handful of catalan politicians eagerly serving interests in brussels london or washington

"__label__fake week 5 rankings 2017 top 20 tight ends
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
tight end continues to be one of the most frustrating positions to fill and trying to maneuver around bye weeks just complicates our decisions even more of course we are starting to get a better understanding of matchups that can be exploited and that helps in finding those streaming plugins who are the options to utilize this week who should we avoid lets take a look at how our rankings shake out
rob gronkowski new england patriots at tampa bay zach ertz philadelphia eagles vs arizona travis kelce kansas city chiefs at houston delanie walker tennessee titans at miami jimmy graham seattle seahawks at los angeles rams charles clay buffalo bills at cincinnati jason witten dallas cowboys vs green bay cameron brate tampa bay buccaneers vs new england benjamin watson baltimore ravens at oakland evan engram new york giants vs los angeles chargers hunter henry los angeles chargers at new york giants kyle rudolph minnesota vikings at chicago jared cook oakland raiders vs baltimore austin seferianjenkins new york jets at cleveland eric ebron detroit lions vs carolina antonio gates los angeles chargers at new york giants jesse james pittsburgh steelers vs jacksonville martellus bennett green bay packers at dallas tyler kroft cincinnati bengals vs buffalo zach miller chicago bears vs minnesota
thoughts
we all know that rookie tight ends are tough to trust but evan engram has already been targeted 30 times and racked up 19 receptions for 200 yards and 1 td you prorate that out for a full 16 weeks and you get 76 catches and 800 yards with the potential for the td count to grow quickly that puts him on the map as a viable te1 option every week
the thought was that delanie walkers value could take a hit thanks to the improved receiving corps and focus on the running game instead walker continues to be not only a viable option but one of the more trustworthy hes topped 50 yards in three of his four games and has also been targeted 6 times in three contests with the constant opportunities hes going to remain a must use option
stepping in for the injured tyler eifert it was a big day for tyler kroft with 6 receptions 68 yards and 2 td against the cleveland browns of course the opponent needs to be considered and we wouldnt expect him to be able to replicate that type of performance theres potential value but hes more of a te2 as opposed to a trustworthy option
the new york giants have allowed 5 td to opposing tight ends meaning both hunter henry and antonio gates need to be on our radars this week neither have been overly impressive but henry has the greater upside and youd think the targets will be there which hasnt been the case most weeks hes a risky te1 but a usable one depending on your alternatives
austin seferianjenkins is coming off a solid week 4 4 receptions for 46 yards and now gets to take on the cleveland browns who are allowing the second most points per week to opposing tight ends while its impossible to trust him as a te1 unless you are desperate hes a viable te2 in all formats

tokyo reuters japans asahi group holdings said on thursday it is considering selling all or part of its 1999 percent stake in tsingtao brewery co ltd its latest divestment from chinas beer industry as it seeks growth in europe and other asian markets
asahis decision to sell the stake which it acquired in 2009 for around 66650 million follows its announcement in june to sell its 20 percent stake in chinese brewer tingyiasahi beverages holding co ltd for 612 million
tsingtao said asahi holds 2701 million of its hong kong listed hshares at thursdays closing price the stake would be valued at nearly hk85 billion 109 billion
the maker of japans bestselling beer asahi super dry has been intensifying its focus on europe scooping up a group of eastern european beer brands from anheuserbusch inbev abibr for 73 billion euros late last year
that move gave the company around 9 percent of the european beer market excluding russia
we are engaging in efforts to restructure our business portfolio with a focus on asset efficiency to assess whether each business contributes to sustainable enhancement of corporate value asahi said in a statement
the company has said that it would restructure its operations in southeast asia and china regions which are facing increased competition as the market consolidates just as growth slows
it did not identify a potential buyer or selling price for the stake
tsingtaos shares in hong kong ended down 23 percent before the announcement and have struggled for traction over the past 12 months
china is the worlds largest beer market by sales but profits have been harder to come by amid fierce competition between local brewers and global beer giants ab inbev heineken nv and carlsberg"
"__label__real moldovan prime minister pavel filip addresses the 72nd united nations general assembly at un headquarters in new york us september 22 2017 reutersshannon stapleton
chisinau reuters moldovas prime minister pavel filip said on monday he was confident of meeting all the conditions to get funding next year under a 100millioneuro 117million agreement with the european union
a reduction in red tape and better fiscal governance had already improved public finances allowing it to get by without the eu cash this year he told reuters
the european union agreed in june to provide 60 million euros in loans and 40 million euros of grants in 201718 to help the former soviet republic to stabilize its economy and promote reform
one condition for receiving it was respect for democratic process and the rule of law the eu added
moldova this year introduced a new electoral law that the venice commission a paneuropean rights body said could make the system more susceptible to undue influence by vested interests
last week filip said moldova would receive no tranches this year but he was more upbeat on 2018 in emailed comments to reuters on monday
the eu has a serious partner in chisinau and we are eager for eu financing in 2018 we are confident all conditions will be met he said
what is important for us and our citizens is predictability including on the eu flank its important not to see the mfa macrofinancial assistance captive to political bickering at home or abroad
moldovas economy grew 41 percent last year recovering from a contraction of 04 percent in 2015 that was due in part to a russian economic crisis that hit exports and remittances from moldovans working there
moldova is hopeful that funding will be available next year while in the meantime we signaled the obvious that moldova is in better shape and can settle its accounts for this year filip said
europes poorest country was rocked by a scandal in which the equivalent of an eighth of its gross domestic product was stolen from three of its largest banks between 2012 and 2014
the world bank and the international monetary fund have forecast moldova will grow 445 percent this year

even prime minister and former footballer aksel vilhelmsson johannesen is helping out offering a welcome to visitors in faroese

i hate the single wild card game because it makes me uneasy all day now tonight the plan is to get home get to my basement put a few coronas in the frig sit with my now 15 year old and watch the yankees play the twins but i yell a lot in this intense game setting because theres just so much pressure on the players and of course us fans too who just want a nice win for a team that has given their all this entire season the series bet of 3 best of 5 best of 7 is so much better than a single game because you can pivot strategy if need be after you get a look at your matchup each time but not in a single game its about the stress of not screwing up and all of that for me the fan i freak out its not that i dont trust the yankees i kind of worry about joe girardi
photo getty images
joes done a pretty good job this season i tip my cap but there are those moments where you throw your hands up in disgust and i just hope tonight he doesnt overthink it and overtinker and rather just let the team play one of my favorites kevin kernan writes this gem about the yanks and girardi and about being themselves heres some of that
joe girardi can be high strung joe girardi can be controlling he can have a quick hook as dellin betances has learned but the joe girardi the yankees have seen this season is a much different manager than in the past
photo getty images
girardi has let the yankees play he has stayed out of the way and has let them have fun hes loosened up a bit and as a result these yankees are a blast to watch they lead the majors in smiles thumbs down is their thing
the clubhouse is looser and girardi has allowed personalities to emerge
and all of that is true but what happens if tonight he starts to micromanage because its a playoff game and not a regular season game remember this is one game that determines the next round you blow it there is no next round
photo njcom
brett gardner the unspoken yankee captain said this about the yanks love the looseness here folks
i feel good about our chances brett gardner said i like the fact we get to throw luis severino out there tomorrow hes been pretty darn good this year
photo getty images
love that and love severino but hes young and once again i go back to joe girardi who has an itchy trigger finger and likes to pull guys if they get into a jam it concerns me will joe look at sevy and pull him too soon will he try and relax and like kernan says let them play tough to say right now
look in the end i will be stressed out i think thats been established here and yes i know ultimately we just have to sit back and watch but again the yankees have had quite a season no one expected the playoffs in fact we thought maybe next season was the year and so i just dont want it messed up in one game again its not the yankees i think they can go all the way with what they have i am concerned about their manager though not that i dont have respect for joe i certainly do
my worry is hell tinker when he doesnt have to if he sits back and lets the yankees play i think we will have a nice outcome tonight if he starts cracking open the binder every 3 minutes and making unnecessary pitching changes and late inning pinch hitting it may sabotage the yankees chances in this 1 game wild card playoff and my lord i hope to god that doesnt happen
good luck to my yankees tonight i wish you well ill be the fan in my basement surrounded by yankee memorabilia washing down tums with a bottle of corona

"__label__real washington cnn the next step in steve bannons scorchedearth war against republican incumbents is an attempt to cut off money to those aligned with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell
the former chief strategist in president donald trumps white house spent the weekend in connecticut meeting with top republican donors a source familiar with bannons plans said as he recruits financial support for enough candidates to nationalize an antiestablishment message in 2018 gop primaries
hes held similar meetings in new york city and washington speaking with more than 25 major gop donors so far including hedge fund manager scott bessent energy executive dan eberhart private equity firm ceo john childs and megadonors robert and rebekah mercer
it was a continuation of what hes done every day since september 26 when the bannonbacked former judge roy moore ousted sen luther strange in an alabama republican primary hold meetings to recruit candidates and form a donor network to back them
bannons raison detre is to take on mcconnell and nationalize republicans behind trump
his thinking evidenced by the senates failure to advance trump agenda items like health care is that washington republicans do not support trump anyway so 2018 could be a defining moment shaking up the gop and placing trumps 2016 campaign agenda at its forefront
what bannon is seeking from prospective candidates the source said is one simple pledge that they wont vote for mcconnell as senate majority leader
bannons recruiting efforts have intensified over the last two weeks he is now looking for candidates who can replicate sen mike lees stunning ouster of former sen robert bennett at utahs 2010 republican convention next year against sen orrin hatch and he is in contact with allies in nebraska seeking a candidate to take on sen deb fischer
and thats just a partial list the source familiar with bannons plans said
nobodys safe the source said
already he had spoken with erik prince the blackwater security contractor and gop megadonor foster friess about running against republican sen john barrasso in wyoming
bannon has also backed kelli wards effort to oust arizona sen jeff flake he hosted danny tarkanian in washington to discuss his campaign against sen dean heller in nevada and he met recently with mississippi state sen chris mcdaniel about taking on sen roger wicker
mcdaniel who said he is strongly considering running against wicker said monday that he and bannon have been in regular contact since 2014 when mcdaniel came close to unseating sen thad cochran support from bannon is helpful mcdaniel said with strong trump supporters who know bannon was a leading figure on the presidents campaign and with those who read breitbartcom where bannon is a top executive
you factor in the big news he made in 2016 mcdaniel said you factor in his drive his work ethic and people sense a winner and understand he can bring resources to bear whether its breitbart or with financial resources
bannon also plans to get involved in the primaries in west virginia and missouri two of republicans top opportunities to pick off democraticheld seats next year
the plan the source said is for these bannonites to nationalize their 2018 message with a consolidated consistent argument across the map
bannon wants that message to be about big things that the grassroots republican voters are in control and that they dont need the establishments money or what he views as its corruption
just watched wh official warns trump not done with corker replay more videos must watch wh official warns trump not done with corker 0309
avoiding another odonnell
bannon the source said believes his insurgent slate will be different than the tea party calamity of 2010 when flawed candidates like christine odonnell in delaware and sharron angle in nevada cost the party seats or 2012 when todd akin in missouri and richard mourdock in indiana made controversial remarks that swung their races in democrats favor
instead bannon the source said is recruiting candidates who are focused on substance particularly immigration and trade and could win over a loose coalition of social conservatives tea party activists and values voters
the test case was alabama where moore a controversial figure who was twice ousted as state supreme court chief justice first for refusing to remove a ten commandments monument and later for refusing to recognize the us supreme courts ruling legalizing samesex marriage defeated strange who benefited from 10 million in advertising from the mcconnellaligned senate leadership fund super pac
in alabama bannon broke with trump who had gone to huntsville for a campaign rally for strange just days before the election
but the two are still in frequent contact bannon spoke to trump in recent days the source said arguing that from trumps perspective the senate is already lost because the president understands he has little support there
as if to underscore that view tennessee sen bob corker the senate foreign relations committee chairman who is retiring rather than running for reelection in 2018 accused trump in a new york times interview of putting the nation on a path to world war iii and said trumps presidency would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation
it was corker who had urged trump in a white house meeting to go to alabama and campaign for strange a decision the president came to regret according to a source who spoke to the president
bannon meanwhile has argued he is taking on republicans who dont support trumps policies
wheres money coming from
one source of financial support for bannonbacked candidates is the great america pac a super pac led by former ronald reagan campaign manager ed rollins
the group plans to roll out an initial set of three endorsements of republican candidates this week
it isnt expected to be as aggressive in seeking to unseat republican incumbents as bannon has been but the super pac does intend to support senate candidates who back trumps agenda and call for the elimination of the senates 60vote threshold to break the filibuster potentially including tennessee rep marsha blackburn ohio state treasurer josh mandel montana state auditor matt rosendale west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey and more
it could also support candidates who could weaken democratic senators seen as potential 2020 trump opponents including elizabeth warren in massachusetts
the reality here is you have to tap into that trump agenda intensity and those are the candidates who can win in the general election said eric beach the great america pac cochair
bannon meanwhile is focused on damaging people who might be considering 2020 in both parties including mitt romney who could run for the senate in utah if hatch retires
the key the source familiar with bannons plans said is to prove the theory of the case that republicans who are antitrump should be gone"
"__label__real he was somebody who had come from somewhere else whod been gotten rid of and a lot of new yorkers can identify with that
though he was the first to admit that he didnt look the part ive been old and baldheaded and ugly since ive been 28 he reflected long afterward tittle became a marquee figure with the giants and one of their most popular players the giants radio station played the novelty song im in love with y a tittle and when tittle connected on long passes yankee stadium reverberated to chants of y a y a
tittle led the giants to eastern conference titles in 1961 62 and 63 though they were beaten each time in the nfl title game
photo
he threw for 242 touchdowns and 33070 yards in his 17 years as a pro and his 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record that stood for 21 years he was named the leagues most valuable player in 1963 in an associated press poll and elected to the pro football hall of fame in 1971
the end for tittle as one of footballs best and most resilient quarterbacks essentially came in pittsburgh on sept 20 1964 in his 17th bruising year in the pros when a massive lineman slammed him to the ground in a game that tittles giants lost to the steelers
advertisement continue reading the main story
slowly tittle tried to pull himself up off the turf woozy from a concussion and morris berman a photographer for the pittsburgh postgazette was there to snap the picture tittle kneeling his shoulders drooped his helmet knocked off his bald pate exposed his face bloodied
perhaps more than the pro football hall of fame would do later the image immortalized tittle in football lore in the image of the aging warrior who had finally fallen
yelberton abraham tittle jr was born on oct 24 1926 in the east texas town of marshall and grew up there the son of a postal worker as a youngster he idolized texas christians star quarterback sammy baugh and threw footballs through hanging tires as he had seen baugh do in newsreels his older brother jack who went on to play blocking back in the single wing for tulane honed y as football skills when he played junior high and high school football
tittle became a twotime allsoutheastern conference quarterback playing for lsu from 1944 to 1947 having been deferred from military service in world war ii because of asthma as a junior he led the tigers to the 1947 cotton bowl game a 00 tie with arkansas on a windy frigid day
he made his pro debut with the baltimore colts of the allamerica football conference in 1948 and was named rookie of the year he credited his coach cecil isbell formerly an outstanding passer for the green bay packers with finetuning his technique and bolstering his confidence
tittle joined the 49ers when the colts disbanded after the 1950 season their first year in the nfl a later baltimore colts franchise was far more successful
he played for two seasons behind frankie albert a 49ers future hall of famer then became the no 1 quarterback in 1953 he handed off to running backs joe perry hugh mcelhenny and john henry johnson in what became known as the million dollar backfield for brilliance on the field not for the salaries they earned and later threw soaring alley oop passes to r c owens who would race downfield and then outjump defenders
but tittles san francisco teams never won a conference title late in the 1960 season coach red hickey installed a shotgun formation which required occasional scrambling that the aging tittle could not handle hickey benched him in favor of the much younger and more agile john brodie who went on to have a stellar career of his own
photo
shortly before the 1961 season began tittle was traded to the giants for lou cordileone a young guard in what became one of pro footballs most lopsided deals me for tittle a startled cordileone remarked just me
advertisement continue reading the main story
tittle replaced the giants longtime star quarterback 40yearold charlie conerly as the starter for much of the 1961 season teaming up on pass plays with del shofner kyle rote and joe walton he took the giants to the nfl championship game but they lost 370 to the packers on a frozen field at green bay and conerly retired after that
tittle tied an nfl singlegame record by throwing seven touchdown passes against the washington redskins in 1962 he threw 33 touchdown passes for the season setting a league record but frigid wind gusts and a strong green bay rush in the nfl title game at yankee stadium stymied him in the packers 167 victory
tittle passed for 36 touchdowns in 1963 but he tore a knee ligament in the first half against the chicago bears at wrigley field in the nfl championship game when he was tackled by larry morris heavily taped tittle returned for the second half but was unable to properly plant his feet and was intercepted four times as the bears scored a 1410 victory
the giants were an aging team that looked nothing like the eastern division defending champions when they regrouped for the 1964 season the opening game turned into a 387 beating at the hands of the eagles in philadelphia and then it was on to pittsburgh to face the steelers
the giants were leading 140 by the second quarter when tittle deep in giants territory dropped back to pass from the right side tittles throwing side john baker a 6foot7 280pound defensive end saw an opening and smashed into tittle 6 feet and 190 pounds or so as he was about to pass the ball floated loose and into the arms of steelers tackle chuck hinton who ran it back for an easy touchdown
as the steelers celebrated in the end zone tittle knelt there dazed and injured and mr berman captured the moment
the postgazette did not run the photo the next day editors there did not think it was anything special but mr berman entered it for prize consideration and it won the national headliner award for best sports photograph of 1964 it now hangs in the pro football hall of fame in canton ohio

baker had crushed the cartilage in my ribs and brutally gashed my forehead tittle recalled in his memoir nothing comes easy 2009 written with kristine setting clark
i also suffered a concussion and a cracked sternum that photo would later become one of the most enduring images in sports history what a hell of a way to get famous
photo
the play was a turning point pittsburgh went on to win 2724 tittle played out the season hampered by the rib injuries and the giants would finish with only two wins after that i knew it was time to quit especially when i saw our other quarterback gary wood was wanting to date my daughter tittle told richard whittingham the author of giants in their own words 1992
tittle announced his retirement on jan 22 1965 never having played on a championship team in high school college or the pros later that day the jets the giants rival of the american football league held an introductory news conference for joe namath their heralded rookie quarterback
john baker the huge steelers lineman who pummeled tittle died in 2007 after serving for 24 years as sheriff of wake county nc where he was wryly known as little john when baker first ran for the office his supporters printed posters with the photo of the battered tittle and the caption this is what little john is going to do for crime in wake county
i didnt object to that baker told the postgazette in 1979
i was just doing my job he said of his crushing hit on tittle its a tough business
tittle began selling insurance in the off seasons while a 49er after his playing days he developed his company now called y a tittle insurance services and based in san jose calif into a major insurer for silicon valley firms and other businesses along with individuals he hung his famous image from yesteryear in his office with the words nothing comes easy written below
in his memoir of the same name tittle recalled his playing days as a time when i could be my own boss instead of having some guy in the press box with three or four assistants calling plays it was he wrote pro footballs golden era

the mercury news of san jose calif reported that tittle who lived in atherton calif is survived by his daughter dianne de laet who wrote of him in the 1995 book giants heroes his sons john and patrick his brother don seven grandchildren and nine greatgrandchildren his wife minnette died in 2012
in august 1965 when tittle approached the first autumn since his junior high school days when he would not be throwing a football he likened himself to a warrior who had seen his last battlefield
it will be a strange fall for me he told sports illustrated for 27 years from september to december i have put on my armor and gone out to engage in what is really a sort of warfare this fall ill be attending to my insurance business

hawkins played one season in the american basketball league and two seasons with the globetrotters and was a star in his two seasons in the american basketball association which later merged with the nba
hawkinss path to the nba was buoyed in part by a 1969 article in life magazine by david wolf evidence recently uncovered mr wolf wrote indicates that connie hawkins never knowingly associated with gamblers that he never introduced a player to a fixer and that the only damaging statements about his involvement were made by hawkins himself as a terrified semiliterate teenager who thought hed go to jail unless he said what the das detectives pressed him to say
on hawkinss behalf roslyn litman a civil liberties activist along with her husband and law partner s david litman and another lawyer howard specter sued the nba on antitrust grounds arguing that the league had in effect illegally banned hawkins and deprived him of the opportunity to earn a livelihood
they won the league paid hawkins a settlement of nearly 13 million and dropped the ban hawkins joined the nba in 1969 and became an instant star with the suns

hawkins averaged more than 24 points a game sixth best in the nba in his first season with the suns and he was named to the allnba first team
he put up impressive numbers for several more years but when his skills began to erode he was traded to the lakers early in the 197374 season

bizarre things that just dont make sense about the las vegas mass shooting false flag event
 
 
 
 written by jaywill7497
emigrate while you still can learn more
 
theyre engaging us with engineered psychological warfare to destabilize a demographic to sanction more control or deflect from an occurrence theyre pushing through ive read some believe this is to deflect from the nfl ordeal nevertheless the past deep state moves were mirrored prior to justifying un globalist legislation to incrementally turn the thumbscrews to enslave us further
 
 
my prayers go out to all those supposedly killed or injured in the las vegas shooting and in a country where so many antiamericans are kneeling in pampered protest this mass shooting observed veterans and police officers standing up assisting the victims and maneuvering directly for the shooter to take him out of course we all understand dead man tells no tales real americans dont kneel they stand and get to work to save lives currently i give tremendous gratitude to all the first responders who helped save lives and end the violence
 
despite the fact that the news reporting on this shooting is still in its early stages there are five bizarre things that just dont add up about this carnage i run through them below
 
1 masses of concertgoers reported the presence of multiple shooters
 
 
although law enforcement claims there was only one shooter multiple witnesses are publicly reporting the presence of multiple shooters this could reasonably be the response to confusion and chaos but its also highly suspect that the shooter had full auto weapon which is typically limited to law enforcement or military personnel
 
this question about multiple shooters was also raised after the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting in which countless witnesses reported the presence of multiple shooters
 
if this shooting was executed by multiple shooters it would clearly suggest planning and coordination among a group of individuals who sought to carry out the shooting for a political purpose of some kind
 
2 who informed concertgoers they were all going to die a full 45 minutes before the shooting began
 
 
via the uk express
 
one woman who was at the route 91 music event claimed an unidentified woman had told other concertgoers they were all going to die after pushing her way to the front of the venue
 
the witness 21 told local news she had been messing with a lady in front of her and telling her she was going to die that we were all going to die
 
they escorted her out to make her stop messing around with all the other people but none of us knew it was going to be serious
 
she described the lady as hispanic the lady was escorted from the venue along with a man
 
the unnamed witness who was attending the event on her 21st birthday described the pair as short both around 5 ft 5ins to 5ft 6ins tall and looked like everyday people
 
its obvious that neither of these two individuals were the shooter as the shooter is a much taller caucasian dude therefore this is not a lone gunman massacre there was coordination at least three individuals were mindful this shooting was about to take place
 
3 the weapon you pick up on videos was full auto which is almost improbable to obtain through legal means
 
 
the multitude of videos that captured the situation plainly reveal that at least one shooter was running a full auto weapons system such weapons are almost unattainable for civilians to purchase although some pre1986 full auto weapons are accessible for sale they call for extensive atf documentation background checks and extremely long wait periods approaching one year additionally they tend to cost 25000 or more and theyre incredibly rare
 
full auto weapons on the other hand are commonly owned by police officers federal officials and military organizations it will be very fascinating to find out where this weapon came from and exactly how it was obtained
 
4 why were the exits obstructed trapping suckers like rats in a maze
 
countless reports from witnesses who were on the scene disclose that practically all the exits were obstructed one witness detailed the scenario as being caught like a rate in a maze with many dead ends
 
why were practically all the exits blocked basically the concert created a kill zone that amplified the casualties until now based on the clark county sheriff in vegas 515 individuals have been injured and 59 folks have so far died these are unspeakable numbers drawing near wartime casualty counts its apparent from the coverage that this shockingly high body count would not have been likely if folks had been free to flee the concert venue
 
basically the concert trapped the folks preventing them from escaping and denying them the capacity to seek cover from there continual fullauto gunfire is almost improbable to survive
 
furthermore once the shooting began the stage lights were aimed to the crowd lighting up the audience and making them an much easier target for the shooters was this planned
 
5 so why did the shooter have as many as 10 firearms in his room
 
based on news reports the shooter known as stephen paddock had as many as 10 firearms in his room which include several rifles if he was the sole shooter whats the issue of using so many rifles one dude can clearly only shoot one rifle and since he possessed a full auto rifle he could clearly accomplish his evil aims by concentrating on his one rifle there was no demand for him to have numerous rifles
 
hence were the other rifles contributed to the room to stage the crime scene with an large quantity of guns why would one elderly man make an effort to carry 8 10 weapons to a hotel room to begin with thats a lot of work rifles are not lightweight equipment
 
i get the concept that a lone elderly man would carry so many rifles to a hotel room for no sensible reason to be tremendously suspect it makes no sense at all

i know jeter wants to impress in miami and get a winning team and all of that but i was annoyed originally when he canned all the former marlins icons and hall of famers because for me that was part of the charm and marketing of the marlins is jeet gonna replace them with personalities or will it be more old white guys in charge i wonder if jorge is coming i wonder if there is a meaning to his madness
who knows i just find his new job interesting and its strange but fun to watch

"__label__real christian pulisic has been a bright spark in the uss campaign but will have to wait at least another four years to make his world cup debut
the united states failed to qualify for the world cup for the first time since 1986 after losing to trinidad tobago and a controversial goal for panama
the us started the night in the third qualifying place but ended up fifth after losing 21
panama jumped up to third after an 88thminute winner against costa rica to reach their first world cup finals
however it was their opening goal that caused debate with gabriel torres header not appearing to cross the line
the 52ndminute equaliser came from a corner with torres effort hitting the post and as blas perez tried to force the ball over the line ticos defender ronald matarrita looked to have cleared it
however despite complaints from the visitors referee walter lopez of guatemala gave the goal
honduras beat alreadyqualified group winners mexico to also leapfrog the us and secure fourth spot in the table and a twoleg playoff against australia
the us beat panama 40 just last friday but despite playing a trinidad tobago side with just three points from nine games before kickoff never looked close to securing a place in russia
we had everything there for us coach bruce arena said
we failed on the day no excuses we failed today we should have walked off this field with at least a point we should not be staying at home for this world cup and i take responsibility
omar gonzalez stretched to cut out a cross and only succeeded in steering the ball past veteran goalkeeper tim howard before alvin jones rocketed in a superb 35yard strike to double the hosts lead
borussia dortmund teenager and star of the win in panama christian pulisic gave the us hope soon after the restart with a fine longrange goal of his own but with honduras beating mexico it looked like a playoff place for the states
and then with time running out in panama city torres who plays his club football in seattle latched on to a long ball forwards and smashed in off the crossbar to send panama through and leave the us in the wilderness
centreback roman torres was the hero for panama with an 88thminute winner
the most surreal and embarrassing night in us soccer history
in contrast to panama the united states has a population of 3231 million their opponents on tuesday trinidad and tobago have a population of 13m roughly the same as the us state of maine
described as the most surreal and embarrassing night in us soccer history and simply devastating by american journalists the players were left in tears following their shock 21 loss
this is the first time the us have failed to qualify for the world cup since 1986
captain michael bradley described the night as the perfect storm
everything that could have possibly gone wrong did in this stadium and in two other stadiums across the region he added
to give away the first goal like that on an own goal is a killer but the reality is it was all there for us and we have nobody to blame but ourselves"

ever since the us congress gave the us pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers a get out of jail free card exonerating them of all legal and financial product liabilities vaccines have proliferated to the point of extreme infringements and health harms upon humans including their rights to selfdetermination for themselves and their children
however outside the usa there is no such collusion going on between government agencies and big pharma many legal lawsuits against vaccine makers have been filed especially against those who manufacture the hpv vaccines which are damaging both male and female youngsters see the statistics posted from the cdcs vaers reporting system on the sanevax homepage ever since the hpv vaccines were first introduced in 2006 until june 2017 51956 adverse events from hpv vaccines have been reported to vaers along with 328 deaths
now let me ask you this question what would happen to a sausage maker a car maker or any other product manufacturer if there were that many consumer problems reported to proper government agencies what happened with the takata air bag problemsrecalls
the new york times reported in february of 2015
in an escalating standoff with takata federal regulators said on friday that they would begin to fine the japanese auto supplier 14000 a day saying it had not fully cooperated in an investigation into defective airbags
what happened to volkswagen for its fraudulent emission scheme a 43 billion settlement
volkswagen has agreed to pay 43 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations over its diesel emissions cheating scheme involving some 590000 vehicles in the us 2
what about product recalls the website wwwrecallsgov states the us consumer product safety commission cpsc has jurisdiction over more than 15000 kinds of consumer products but vaccines are not listed arent they healthcare consumer products
the very fact vaccines are treated totally differently when in fact they can contain nothing short of hazmat materials mercury thimerosal aluminum in four formulations formaldehyde plus other toxic chemicals foreign dna human diploid cells from aborted fetal cell lines msg antibiotics etc 3 which are injected via a syringe into newborns 246 month old infants toddlers teens adults and senior citizens
adverse effects and contraindications from every vaccine are reported on vaccine package inserts 4 by manufacturers but federal state and local health agencies including school districts do not advise parents and prospective vaccinees of those real and potential adverse health dangers andor effects why collusion
shouldnt the media be the first line of communication about the dangers of vaccines why is the media so bamboozled into disseminating false and fraudulent vaccine information shouldnt such collusion be prosecuted as a criminal actnot telling consumers about the toxins in vaccines and the possible health risks wheres informed consent or is the administering physicians mandate to get inoculated considered informed consent
and yet vaccine safety advocates who are vocal about the fraud at the cdcfda and the hazardous vaccine ingredients plus the horror stories of what happened to vaccinedamaged vaccinees are harassed and even prosecuted as in australia
is australia the betamarket test venue for just how far totalitarian health mandates can be enforced
or are there too many vested interests at stake in australia eg pharmaceutical maker csl hpv vaccine interests 5 prime minister tony abbotts daughters not to be vaccinated but everyone else must get vaccinated 6 lucy turnbull the current prime ministers wife and chairman of pharmaceutical company prima biomed a company trying to get out a cancer vaccine 7
here is a video which shows the numerous antivaccination policy demonstrations that have taken place in various countries around the world and documented on film but never shown on the usa tv evening news or talked about in daily newspapers why collusion
watch in amazement and listen to the stories told about vaccine horrors in australia poland italy germany usa and kenya
httpswwwfacebookcomavnorgauvideos2001681173454938
innocent children and adults are being harmed deliberately by several entities responsible for promoting the falsehood that vaccines are safe
fraud at the cdc has been exposed by whistleblowers see the documentary vaxxed from catastrophe to coverup two merck company former employees filed a qui tam lawsuit in philadelphia pa federal court regarding falsified mumps vaccine efficacy reporting for almost ten years 8 plus others i cannot recite here and which ive written about over the years
the hhss hrsa has paid out almost 36 billion in vaccine damage claims and attorneys fees 9
what does that tell you and prove
when will the citizens of the usa wake up and demand the repeal of the national childhood vaccine injury act ncvia of 1986 42 usc 300aa1 to 300aa34 which literally is responsible for all the vaccine problems we have in the usa
october is vaccine injury awareness month please tell everyone you know about the falsehoods and health damages from unproven unsafe vaccines

"__label__real istanbul turkey cnn turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has launched a new tirade against the us criticizing its support for kurdish fighters in syria and accusing the country of sheltering a terrorist
in a scathing address to regional governors in ankara erdogan accused the us of sacrificing its yearsold relationship with turkey
the speech appeared to dash hopes for a speedy end to the dispute between the two countries which have been at loggerheads since the arrest of a us consular staff member just over a week ago metin topuz a turkish national who works for the us consulate in istanbul is the second us mission staff member in turkey to be detained this year
both sides have frozen many visa services in each others countries and erdogan said he would no longer recognize the authority of us ambassador john bass whom he blames for the breakdown in relations
the decision of the us embassy and the statements that followed are neither fair nor truthful erdogan said in the capital ankara on thursday
he slammed washington for giving weapons for free to a terror organization a reference to the kurdish ypg a key us ally in the fight against isis in syria
he claimed the us had sent 3500 trucks of weapons in to syria including heavy arms saying they were being used by the ypg to encircle us from the south
the us has long supported the ypg and began openly supplying arms to it this year the ypg is the backbone of a larger coalition of rebels that the us is backing to drive isis from syria
ankara is worried that the kurds may make territorial gains near the turkish border if isis is finally flushed out of the area
in washington state department spokeswoman heather nauert responded to the accusations and challenged the turkish government to provide any evidence to support the allegation that the two employees engaged in terrorism she also called on turkey to give the staffers access to their attorneys
nauert said the us government has some very real concerns about the handling of these cases and suggested the government might be trying to subvert usturkey law enforcement cooperation by detaining the employees who were working in an office tasked with that issue
we hope turkey is not trying to create distance between us and them on that she said
gulen erdogans adversary
the relationship between the us and turkey has been on a downward spiral since a failed coup in 2016 erdogan and his government blame muslim cleric fethullah gulen for orchestrating the coup attempt and have repeatedly pushed washington to extradite him from the us
the turkish government blames fethullah gulen for orchestrating the failed coup
turkey accuses topuz the arrested consular employee of having ties to the gulenist network which turkey considers a terrorist organization
the istanbul chief prosecutor is seeking a third us consular staff member for questioning and has accused him of hiding in the us consulate
on the one hand youre going to say im the native home of democracy on the other hand you are going to shelter a terrorist erdogan said it was not clear if he was referring to gulen or the third consular employee
bass denied any knowledge of a third employee being sought
erdogan also touched on the sensitive issue of an american pastor andrew brunson who has been detained in turkey for more than a year
he said that the pastor had obvious links to gulenists erdogan even suggested two weeks ago that the two men could be swapped raising concerns that brunson may have been detained as a bargaining chip
erdogan targets obama officials
erdogan also took a second shot at the us ambassador blaming him for the latest troubles
honestly speaking it is the ambassador here who instigated this incident it is not acceptable that the usa is sacrificing its relations with its strategic partner turkey for an irresponsible ambassador we can not accept this he said
bass complained this week that turkey had given the us no explanation as to why its consular staff members were detained he also suggested turkish officials were trying to purposely disrupt relations
erdogan who spoke of warmer relations with the us when donald trump was elected president seemed to throw that accusation back at the us suggesting that officials left over from the obama administration were trying to rattle the turkeyus relationship
unfortunately a clique from the past administration that is within the american government wants to bring down an ax on relations between turkey and the current us administration he said"

"__label__fake nfl picks week 5
before its news
many who stayed up late to watch the end of the monday night game between the washington football team and the kansas city chiefs saw a bizarre finish that could only be dubbed one thing the true definition of a bad beat
washington attempted to win the game on a bunch of lateral passes it did not go as planned as justin houston eventually scooped up the loose football and took it in for a touchdown as time expired while it may have seemed like a meaningless touchdown in the game it had huge ramifications in vegas the touchdown led to an epic cover for the chiefs and the over while those who bet washington and the under watched their winnings go down the drain
if you happened to parlay the chiefs and the over it seemed all but over as time ticked away in the fourth we have seen the lateral plays countless times and they never amount to a score so many may have already turned their televisions off by that time little did they know they woke up in the morning as a winner if you did stay awake for the entire game i am almost guarantee the rush from such a huge win kept you up a lot later than you wanted
now imagine if you were on the other side the feeling inside your stomach as houston picked that ball up broke a few tackles and found his way into the end zone is basically a kick to where the sun doesnt shine thats the worst way any gambler can lose a game
there is a motto for those who dab into the vegas lines here and there and thats scared money dont make money the bad losses will be there so will the epic wins its all about being on the right side every sunday and thursday and monday and saturday later in the season to make money by the end of the nfl campaign
im here to hopefully help you out
if youve followed my writing throughout the years you have seen that betting lines are something i like to take part in its too easy to pick a winner and a loser each week testing your football knowledge against the pros in vegas is more challenging and what the hell making a few bucks on the side never hurt anyone
while we are starting this a few weeks into the nfl season there is still plenty of time left to finish the year with a profit each week i will give my best bets for the nfl and of course which side to take when the ravens take the field
season record 00
all lines are courtesy of scores and odds
baltimore ravens at oakland raiders under 39
not the ideal matchup i would like for my first pick of the year but that has more to do with oakland losing derek carr than anything we have seen from the ravens we have no clue what to expect from the raiders with ej manuel running the offense but then again the ravens dont have much of an offense either both teams will use the ground game to eliminate the sloppy play from their quarterbacks and bank on their defense to make key stops thats the perfect scenario when taking the under also its important to note that both teams have gone over the total once apiece this season and the under has hit in three of their last four meetings in oakland
baltimore md november 10 quarterback joe flacco reacts after a play against the cleveland browns in the third quarter at mt bank stadium on november 10 2016 in baltimore maryland photo by patrick smithgetty images
carolina panthers at detroit lions 2
call me crazy but this could be the best lions team we have seen under jim caldwell detroit made matthew stafford the highestpaid player in the nfl but have turned the offense into one where he isnt forced to throw 50 times a game to win they also have their best defense in years cam newton and company should be thrilled to get a win in foxborough that was more about how bad the patriots defense is than anything else the lions should control this game and even if stafford is down late hes always good for a comeback
arizona cardinals 65 at philadelphia eagles
the cardinals have been one of the hardest teams to gauge this season many felt they could contend for the nfc west but so far their two wins are against the indianapolis colts and san francisco 49ers meanwhile the eagles have been in highly contested games that have come down to the wire if this line goes up to 7 its one you have to take because arizona should keep this game respectable a field goal should win this game and us some money
green bay packers 25 at dallas cowboys
you might think to yourself that the cowboys will respond well after losing to the los angeles rams at home last week its anything but as the defense has been brutal to start the season and coming to jerrys world is aaron rodgers he will have no problem picking apart a defense that just allowed jared goff to throw for 225 yards and two scores heres an interesting nugget to keep in mind also dallas is 014 ats as a home favorite coming off a straight up and ats loss
these are my four winners for week 5
ill take a small finders fee if you ride the money train with me
until next week show me the money

"__label__real file photo us president donald trump calls on republican senators to move forward and vote on a healthcare bill to replace the affordable care act as people negatively affected by the law stand behind him in the blue room of the white house in washington us july 24 2017 reutersjoshua roberts
washington reuters president donald trump was expected to sign an executive order on thursday that would make it easier for americans to buy barebones health insurance plans and circumvent rules put in place by obamacare though such an order could face legal challenges
stymied in congress by the failure of senate republicans to roll back former president barack obamas 2010 healthcare law trumps executive order would represent his administrations latest effort to undermine the law without legislation
the order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy cheaper health plans that would be exempt from some obamacare requirements among the requirements would be the mandate that all health plans cover 10 essential health benefits including maternity and newborn care prescription drugs and mental health and addiction treatment
the order would also change an obamaera limit on the time span people can use shortterm health insurance plans which are cheaper but cover few medical benefits trump was expected to order an extension for the period that long shortterm insurance can be used to about a year versus three months under obamacare
republicans despite having control of the white house and both chambers of congress have for months been unable to make good on their sevenyear promise to repeal obamacare which they view as a government intrusion into americans healthcare
file photo sen rand paul rky speaks at a press conference about the latest republican effort to repeal and replace the affordable care act on capitol hill in washington us september 25 2017 reutersaaron p bernstein
experts questioned whether trump has the legal authority to expand association health plans and whether some plans but not others could be exempt from obamacare rules
the action could open trump to legal challenges from democratic state attorneys general who have said they will sue trump if he tries to destroy obamacare a law that brought health insurance coverage to millions of americans
file photo senator ron johnson rwi speaks with reporters after the failure of the skinny repeal health care bill on capitol hill in washington us july 28 2017 reutersaaron p bernstein
experts said the association health plans could attract young healthy people and leave a sicker more expensive patient pool in the individual insurance markets created under the healthcare law driving up premiums and effectively eroding the laws protection for those with preexisting conditions
conservative groups and lawmakers including republican senator rand paul who said he has worked with trump for months on the expected order and republican senator ron johnson have cheered the expected order paul opposed the senates most recent attempt to overhaul obamacare because he said it left too many of obamcares regulations and spending programs in place
trump has taken a number of steps since assuming power in january to weaken or undermine obamacare he has not committed to making billions of dollars of payments to insurers guaranteed under obamacare prompting many to exit the individual market or hike premiums for 2018
the administration also halved the open enrollment period which begins nov 1 and slashed the obamacare advertising and outreach budget"
"__label__fake the curious case of lichfield ladies
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
i see wasps ladies recently signed england internationals amy cokayne harriet millar mills and justine lucas all of whom previously turned out for lichfield ladies
what seems to be forgotten amidst all the justified hype and excitement surrounding the heady opening weeks of the premier 15s englands new elite domestic rugby competition for women is the fate of lichfield ladies
a seemingly permanent fixture in the womens premiership in england for several years finishing in 3rd place last season lichfield have over the years developed many international players including the three women mentioned above as well as current england skipper sarah hunter emily scarratt natasha hunt and vicky fleetwood
lichfield however failed to be included in the premier 15s following an rfu tender process that effectively replaced them with loughborough lightning loughborough university who prior to this process had never had a team in womens league rugby
as a result lichfield has lost around 30 players many of whom have had to move to topflight clubs in order to be considered for international selection and several of whom have joined loughborough
i have read the judgment of the panel that dismissed lichfields appeal against the rfu decision suffice it to say that the process was not exactly transparent and the judgment brushes over the fact that nicky ponsford the rfus head of womens performance was part of the decision making process
nicky ponsford is an alumni and former coach of loughborough university

green cove springs fl after irma devastated florida most restaurants and stores were shut down in certain areas green cove springs was one of those places so when jack roundtree owner of the triple j bbq food truck arrived in town not only was he welcomed with open arms he was desperately needed as he sold bbq to paying customers roundtree used the extra money to feed utility workers for free for all their hard work however once officials saw a man whod dare sell food in their town without paying them first police were called in to make quick work of this entrepreneurial good samaritan
shut down and get out of townis what roundtree was told by local authorities for both providing charity and a muchneeded product and service why was roundtree told to get out of town you ask well he hadnt paid the local government for the privilege to sell food to those in need inside green cove springs
roundtree is no outlaw in fact green cove springs actually encouraged him to sell his bbq during their monthly saturdayinthepark event before the hurricane but not this time
even if he wouldve gone to city hall to buy a permit to sell during the irma aftermath however he couldntthey were closed
according to clay today
it was interesting to learn that roundtree and his truck were encouraged to serve customers during green coves monthly saturdayinthepark event without a permit but during irmas aftermath not so much had roundtree decided to press his case at city hall he would have been greeted with a sign that read due to hurricane irma city hall offices and services will reopen on thursday sept 14 2017
so instead of allowing roundtree to offer free food to utility workers and sell food to people during their time of need and just get a permit after government employees decided to return to workthey just kicked him out of town
heres how one green cove spring witness bettie tune described the events at richs on her facebook page as reported by clay today
the irony here is that he was kicked out of town for failing to get a permit by government workers because the other government workers who wouldve given him this permit were not at work
in a report from the institute for justice communications coordinator matt powers explains that roundtree is not alone
cities across the country often impose strict regulations that make it nearly impossible for food trucks to operate in 2011 ij launched its national street vending initiative to fight these laws in baltimore the institute for justice ij is challenging a ban on food trucks parking within 300foot of a brickandmortar business that sells the same type of food in chicago ij is challenging regulations that bans food trucks from operating within 200 feet of a brickandmortar business serving food and forces them to install gps tracking devices that broadcast their every move and ij is challenging a louisville kentucky law banning food trucks from operating within 150 feet of any restaurant selling similar food
these strict regulations are ostensibly designed for food safety but in reality serve to raise revenue for the state and limit established restaurants competition they also stifle economic growth
as the ij noted
the firearms survival guide ad it is not only during times of crisis that food trucks contribute to their communities according to ijs report streets of dreams mobile vending businesses help people escape poverty and unemployment through affordable startup costs which creates the initial economic opportunity for upward mobility ijs report seven myths and realities found the presence of food trucks can actually help local restaurant industries by attracting new customers and serving as incubators for new restaurants cities should embrace food trucks and liberate them from onerous regulations so they can enjoy the benefits these businesses bring
when people in need are denied food they are willing to purchase because government workers arent in the office to sell the maker of that food a permission slip something is wrong in the land of the free
as tftp reported earlier this month this problem is everywhere it stifles local economic growth persecutes the poor the hardest and turns hardworking entrepreneurs into criminals ripe for the extortion of state
luckily thanks to martin flores who filmed an innocent hot dog vendor named beto get robbed by a berkeley police officer for selling hot dogs americans are seeing the harsh reality that is making a living in a police state

the bsi has no indications at this time that the process occurred as described in the media

the us government last month ordered kaspersky software removed from government computers saying it was concerned the moscowbased cyber security firm was vulnerable to kremlin influence
kaspersky lab has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in russian hack1ing kaspersky lab has never helped nor will help any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts a company statement said on tuesday in response to the new york times report

"__label__fake now a sitcom about an illegal family
before its news
cdn httpwwwconservativedailynewscom
by jim clayton
todays media conglomerates seem at least as interested in resisting president donald trump as they are in actually making money so it was with great fanfare that abc announced a new sitcom called sanctuary family coming soon to the network this is the same network that canceled the highly rated and successful tim allen sitcom last man standing people protested when they took it off and tim allen himself said it was because it was about a conservative guy and his family and made a lot of sense there was also a lot of antiobama and antihillary jokes in it
abc denied it was taken off because of that and said they were going to make friday nights an all drama night they also said they had writers and people on the show who had all different kinds of views and all got along fine they also said all the characters on the shows contracts were coming up and they would naturally ask for raises which the station couldnt afford tim allen even went on one of the late night talk shows saying in hollywood if you dont tow the liberal line they boycott you or cancel you
a large part of these jobs are managing failure and we have made the tough calls and canceled shows that we would otherwise love to stay on the air thats the job i canceled last man standing for the same business and scheduling reasons that i canceled dr ken the real oneals the catch and american crime abc entertainment president channing dungey told reporters tuesday ahead of her upfront presentation to advertisers last man standing was a challenging one for me because it was a steady performer in the ratings but once we made the decision not to continue with comedies on fridays that was where we landed
from a financial point of view abc did not own last man standing and had been reducing licensing fees on many of its aging shows including sonys the goldbergs abc studios once upon a time and 20th tvs modern family in a bid to reduce costs amid dwindling viewership and ad dollars
tim allen reacts to liberal hollywoods antitrump crusade youtube
this new show will apparently involve a married couple who invite their illegal immigrant nanny and her family to come live with them hijinks and culture clash ensue but the network promises that everyone will learn the important lesson that the differences both families have arent as significant as their similarities
deadline points out that the sitcom will be only one of many immigrantfocused television shows coming to the airwaves in the next year both cbs and the cw have immigrantbased dramas in the pipeline cbss fare is called have mercy and it will feature a hispanic doctor who practices medicine illegally since she cannot as an illegal immigrant get a proper medical license on the cw well have illegal which focuses on a teenager coming to terms with his familys notquitelegal status both shows are being produced by jane the virgin actor gina rodriguez whose original show also focuses quite a lot on illegal immigration
this has been the way since the 1980s first it was the homosexuals now this it was inevitable the left shames society by championing the perverse portraying it as edgy and fresh this began by debasing programs such as father knows best and leave it to beaver as camp and unrealistic they may have been unrealistic but they portrayed life in the american home as warm loving wholesome and moral something the left can neither relate to nor tolerate they view it with contempt and something that requires destruction and replacement with their totalitariansocialistglobalist perspective
i remember when i was a kid when they started taking westerns like bonanza and laredo and sitcoms like green acres and mayberry rfd off the air and started with their urban shows like all in the family which was nothing but left wing propaganda they used the show to make archie bunker who was the conservative head of the household look like a poorly educated dolt while making collegeeducated son in law a leftwing radical now here it is 45 years later and actually the archie bunker character was right about the destruction that has happened in this country
i wonder if the producers of these new shows will use real illegals for them instead of american actors if so will they pay them cheaper labor like current american employers do when they hire illegals as cheap labor over american workers just asking

raiders throw game to punish qb who wouldnt protest trump where is roger goodell now
after the nfl commissioner roger goodell turned zealot and decided patriots qb tom bradey must be punished for someone underinflating a game ball by 15 lbs of pressure and for tom brady being unable to discern this from holding a frozen ball in the middle of january in the middle of the super bowl he should be suspended on absolutely zero evidence we will see where he stands on an entire offensive line throwing a game due to racial and political divides that nfl players have decided to drag the league i personally will not watch another pro football game for the rest of my life i am not kidding you
goodwell has now come out on the side of the players who protested trump and threw a football game so as to draw attention away from this scandal by calling trump devisive is there any doubt goodwell is a moral coward if hypocrisy is the respect that vice pays to virtue goodwell has now paid enough to bankrupt the entire nfl
below is the full story for which there is tons of ample direct and circumstantial evidence where is goodwell now will he be too much of a coward to deal with the situation that threatens to destroy the nfl there is much more evidence for this than there ever was for going after tom brady now everyone will act as if this criminal matter never took place because they simple dont have the nerve to follow their own rules and standards when it really counts it is so much easier to go after one white man than it is to go after an entire offensive line of africanamericans corrupting the game of football due to their political affiliations and protests against america if goodwell does nothing americans ought to protest en mass

before its news
cdn httpwwwconservativedailynewscom
by curtice mang
this past sunday there was more kneeling at nfl games than occurred at catholic churches around the country most fans turn on a professional football game to watch you know football recently they have been treated to anything but
what the heck is going on as a public service and in an effort to promote peace love and understanding well maybe not the first two here are a few frequently asked questions that may shed some light on the nfls most recent trend of taking a knee during the singing of the national anthem
q what is this whole take a knee business all about
a it all started last season when colin kaepernick decided to kneel during the national anthem to protest oppressed minorities and people of color in the united states
q who is colin kaepernick
a he used to play quarterback for the san francisco 49ers his salary for the 2016 season was 119 million
q thats a lot of money is he any good
a well he won three of the last 19 games he started at quarterback including one win last year
q hold on im doing the math here if my figures are correct last season he made 119 million for each game he won right
a im not the greatest at math in high school algebra my grade was a p for pathetic nonetheless even i can do this math and i got the same answer if anyone was oppressed last season it was the 49ers fans
q if kaepernick had a regular job how long would it take him to earn 119 million
a about 183 years he could knock a few years off that if he worked overtime either way hed probably be dead long before that
q a lot of players are taking a knee this season are they protesting oppression in the united states or do they have other reasons
a they are each hoping to land the next 119 million salary or at least get that big antifa endorsement deal theyre talking to you george soros
q i heard the pittsburgh steelers chose to remain in the locker room rather than be on the field during the national anthem is that true
a yes in a show of solidarity the entire team save one stayed in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem and as it turns out they remained there for almost the entire first quarter fortunately for the steelers they were playing the chicago bears and only trailed 70 by the time they finally took the field
q it sure seems like the nfl allows its players a lot of freedom to express themselves is that true
a sure in much the same way that kim jong uns inner circle gets to tell him that north koreas nuclear program is probably a bad idea the nfl once fined kaepernick for wearing the wrong headphones to a postgame interview the league had an endorsement deal with bose to be the official headphone sponsor kaepernick protested claiming his headphones were prescribed by a doctor dr dre but to no avail
q this take a knee stuff is catching on will more teams do it in the coming weeks
a thats hard to say although cleveland browns fans will argue their team has spent much of the first three games taking a knee
q is this controversy hurting the nfls tv ratings
a the ratings for the league are down substantially however its hard to say if it is because of this controversy or because millions of americans had a sudden urge to go kayaking this past sunday
q who is in charge of the nfl
a nobody really knows roger goodell is the league commissioner but he seems about as strong as a runny jello mold hes sort of the mitch mcconnell of the nfl if you had to pick who you would rather be in a fox hole with you would choose the enemy over roger goodell
q some teams stood during the national anthem locked arm in arm what was the point of that
a some teams did it as a show of unity
q um isnt that what standing for the anthem is all about in the first place
a yes
q so then whats the point
a beats me
q one last question what did colin kaepernick do on sunday
a he took a kneein his living room to count his money

"__label__fake stunning admission about alien autopsy film
 
man behind infamous alien autopsy video finally crucial details about the creation of the film and its legitimacy the creator spyros melaris has now openly admitted that his infamous alien autopsy film was entirely faked and has offered an explanation for how he was able to fool so many
 
in his new one man show on west end melaris reveals that the film claiming to show an alien body being examined in the 1940s was actually faked and shot in a north london flat
 
the famous alien autopsy video
 
 
he explains that his dead alien shown in the 17 minute clip watched by millions of people around the world was actually a sculpture made for him by john humphreys humphreys was a special effects expert known for his work on the television show dr who
 
melaris 58 explain to his west end audience how he made such a convincing mockup in order to create a realistic look for the doctors in the video he sourced 1940s surgeons outfits and medical instruments from prop providers in the uk and usa

hackers claim john mccain knew isis execution videos were staged 
 
he explains that the two government pathologists in the video who were filmed dissecting the pale potbellied corpse of the extraterrestrial being were in reality his brother and girlfriend in a camden apartment
 
as for the aliens innards they used cow and lamb organs from a local butcher shop he explains that at one point they even considered using raspberry jelly for the brain but felt it looked too dark
 
in order to create a realistic look for the quality of the film itself he spliced 16mm footage onto an original pathe newsreel taken from a 1947 college baseball match in roswell this was done in order to persuade experts who would be familiar with the age of the type of film used that it could be genuine
 
ray santilli a musician reputedly made many millions of dollars by taking the film and claiming the grainy black and white film was a product of the us military he claimed it was created shortly after the 1947 roswell ufo incident thus linking the film with what is likely the most famous ufo sighting in history
 
during his oneman show at londons leicester square theatre on sunday melaris said for me it was just a joke a bit of fun but i have learnt my lesson
 
mr melaris
 
img srchttpsmetrouk2fileswordpresscom201709pri_54377081jpgw620amph1139ampcrop1
 
i would like to say now that there is a big part of me that feels remorse i underestimated the response the reality is that everybody in the ufo community took this film as the smoking gun proof of ufos and aliens
 
however some in the skeptic community are inclined to believe that the footage may in fact still be real and that melaris has been pressured into retracting it one of the first things that do not add up is that although melaris is taking credit for faking the film santilli is the one who actually made it public how can anybody other than the man who found the film and publicized it retract it how could anybody be sure melaris really made the film additionally it is not hard to imagine that after the film regained traction on the internet some government forces felt a need to cover it up they would have then pressured melaris to say he faked the film finally why would a retraction take all of these years the film first became public in 1995 if melaris really did create the film and regret it why would he take 22 years to retract it

"__label__real nairobi reuters kenya lurched deeper into political confusion on wednesday as a court ruling and a parliamentary vote appeared to ease uhuru kenyattas path to a second term as president a day after his chief rival quit an election they were to contest
kenyatta and raila odinga were due to face off in a repeat election on oct 26 after the supreme court annulled their august ballot in which the president was declared the winner
but odinga pulled out of the rerun on tuesday fuelling doubts about whether it would be contested at all wednesdays interventions by the judiciary and legislature added to the uncertainty
as police used teargas to disperse opposition protesters demanding electoral reform the high court approved a petition by ekuru aukot who polled less than 1 percent in the august vote to contest the second ballot
the election board later issued a statement saying that all eight candidates who competed in august would be on the ballot it also said although odinga had notified them of his withdrawal by letter he had not yet submitted the official form to do so
the developments suggested that the second election would go ahead with kenyatta the likely winner against a plethora of weaker candidates no challenger except odinga polled more than 1 percent
further muddying the political waters parliament passed an election law amendment stating that if one candidate withdrew from the rerun vote the remaining one would automatically win the vote was boycotted by opposition lawmakers
the law aimed to ensure kenyatta could be declared president if he faced no challengers
the events stoked confusion among voters and fears that politicallydriven violence might escalate months of political uncertainty have already blunted growth in east africas richest nation a longtime ally of the west
theres a real atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty there seems to be dozens of opinions of what should come next said murithi mutiga a senior horn of africa analyst for the global thinktank international crisis group
unease
justifying his pullout on tuesday odinga said the election would not be free and fair and renewed calls for the electoral board iebc which he blamed for the procedural irregularities identified in the first ballot to be replaced
opposition supporters on wednesday renewed their protests for electoral reform
a supporter of kenyan opposition national super alliance nasa coalition carries a banner depicting kenyan opposition leader raila odinga during a protest along a street in nairobi kenya october 11 2017 reutersbaz ratner
demonstrators lit bonfires in kisumu an odinga stronghold in the countrys west while more than a thousand supporters marched through the central business district in the capital nairobi police used teargas to disperse them in both cities witnesses said
juliana otieno the chief executive of the oginga odinga hospital in the city said 17 people had been admitted with injuries suffered during the protests a reuters witness counted at least five of them with bullet wounds
kisumus police commander titus yoma said he had no information on the bullet wounds and his officers were still quelling the protests which were centered around two slums in the lakeside city
at least 37 people were killed in protests immediately following the august vote almost all of them by police a kenyan rights group said on monday ethnic clashes killed 1200 people following a disputed presidential poll in 2007
we want a reformed iebc said elisha odhiambo an opposition legislator referring to the electoral board which has frequently relied on riot police dispersing protests outside its offices in recent weeks

mombasa governor ali hassan joho a key opposition player told protesters in uhuru park our voices must be heard we have no war with anyone but we will not allow anyone to stifle us
after the high court ruling in his favor aukot told reporters that he still had concerns about the board and would issue a statement in a day or two giving clarity about his plans
it was unclear if other candidates from the first ballot with little support would also seek to be included but the election board said it still had time to print ballot papers
the sept 1 supreme court judgment that nullified kenyattas 14 million vote win also stipulated elections had to be held within 60 days
if that schedule is not met the constitution provides for the speaker of parliament a member of kenyattas party to take power
with two weeks to go until the elections it is still unclear who will stand

cnn all children have incredible potential most with parents teachers and other adults in their lives who want the best for them unfortunately many schools particularly those that serve children with the greatest need face obstacles that limit childrens educational success rote curriculums insufficient support for teachers and scant extracurricular options to name a few
educators parents and policymakers have long acknowledged such obstacles but we now know that there is another significant consideration prolonged stress at home can disrupt development and set children back before school even begins
one year ago we opened the primary school to 51 4yearolds from east palo alto and belle haven california since then we have welcomed another 200 lowincome children and their families to our integrated approach to education and health care
as we begin our second school year we want to share some of what we have learned from our effort to build a model of care that truly supports the physical intellectual and emotional needs of our communitys highestneed children and while we are still in the early stages and have much more to learn part of our longterm mission is also to identify innovative solutions for how to serve the needs of the whole child smart approaches that can one day be deployed in communities across the nation
why we need this
a growing body of research shows that trauma at home can seriously affect a childs health and education physical or emotional abuse neglect parental mental illness exposure to violence or the accumulated burdens of poverty can trigger what is known as a toxic stress response
in the short term this can inhibit childrens ability to learn to manage emotions and build relationships with peers putting them at a disadvantage before they ever even set foot in a classroom children who have experienced four or more traumatic experiences are more than 30 times more likely to have a learning or behavior problem than their more fortunate peers

in the long run toxic stress can actually disrupt the development of the brain and other organs and body systems and increase the risk for chronic disease heart attack stroke mental illness and cognitive impairment well into adulthood
the condition is not uncommon a seminal study led by the centers for disease control and prevention and kaiser permanente found that one in five adults at all income levels had experienced three or more adverse childhood experiences
despite the prevalence of toxic stress and the severity of its impact on childrens lives existing education health and social support systems are not set up to help the children most likely to experience trauma which often goes untreated at the primary school we are seeking to acknowledge and address toxic stress so we can arm our children with the academic skills they need to succeed in college and beyond
this incredibly complex problem cannot be solved by tinkering at the edges instead we have tried to build an entirely new system of care centered around a childs comprehensive needs we are still very early in our work and are learning more every day but our approach is grounded in three important ideas
we start early
just watched toddler inhales the dangers of smoking replay more videos must watch toddler inhales the dangers of smoking 0132
the majority of brain development happens in the first five years of life the achievement gap between lowincome children and their wealthier peers begins to open as early as nine months of age and still most children start school at age 5
by then much of the wiring that enables learning and socioemotional management is in place we work with families as early as birth to reach children in this critical time helping caregivers build strong relationships with their children and our fulltime school begins at age 3
we work with not around families
home life and environment are stronger predictors of academic and health outcomes than either formal education or health care furthermore research has shown that consistent nurturing from an adult has the greatest power to protect a child from toxic stress we know all parents want the best for their children and have tremendous strengths as individuals and parents
and so each parent works with a coach and teachers to help them promote learning at home achieve their own goals and build powerful connections with other parents we also partner with existing community organizations to connect families to muchneeded resources including food housing and legal and mental health services
we unite health care and education in a seamless system of care
healthcare providers and educators rarely work together to address childhood stress and trauma educators often lack access to critical information that could help them understand what they are seeing in the classroom physicians also are often unaware of physical or emotional issues that show up at school first or the conditions at home that may impede development
another barrier physicians encounter is in getting families to make longterm behavioral changes such as interventions for developmental delays obesity and dental care that require regular support and reinforcement so we partner closely with primarycare providers to ensure children are getting highquality care that extends beyond the walls of the physicians office
just watched kids biggest fears when going back to school replay more videos must watch kids biggest fears when going back to school 0228
for every child a group of adults including the parent teacher coach and healthcare provider works together to construct a shared understanding of the child and better solve health problems this may include a physical health need like asthma that requires consistent support at home and school or a mental health concern that is difficult to diagnose without a full view of child behavior
our experience with this model makes us optimistic every day we see anecdotal evidence of what scientific research has already shown children and adults can build resilience and thrive even in the face of trauma we hope that with the support of our families and community partners we can provide a strong foundation for all children to succeed in school and life and we hope other schools and healthcare systems around the country can benefit from what we learn here
we all owe our children more than incremental solutions we owe them a new system that gives every child regardless of background the opportunity to live a healthy independent and meaningful life with so much work ahead of us we look forward to sharing our stumbles and triumphs as we learn for and with our children and are excited to be among the practitioners and policymakers committed to this challenge"

no problem
even the washington post 102 expresses puzzlement among the questions they investigators have how he stephen paddock was able to bring it a weapon and many other weapons into a vegas hotel suite undetected
las vegas sheriff lombardo said hotel staff had been in and out of the tworoom suite which paddock had stayed in since sept 28 and spotted nothing nefarious though he had more than 10 suitcases
i see ten suitcases more than 10 how many fifteen
paddock a highstakes gambler the casinos know well a man they know is a local resident suddenly shows up with 10 suitcases hotel staff are in and out of his suite and no one has questions
this raises no red flags
in a city where the hotels and casinos have many layers of security including metal detectors paddock quietly slipped in with more than 10 suitcases holding weapons and ammo
the city of las vegas has shown up in isis chatter as a target of interest wouldnt that cause hotels and casinos to step up their already heavy security
a year ago ktnv reported terrorism is very much in the forefront of every casino owners mind said retired lt randy sutton 13 action news crime and safety expert
in the same ktnv piece hotel magnate steve wynn said las vegas is a target city we have hardened the target at the wynn hotel this is the first time ive ever revealed this publicly but we went theres a division in the marine corps of special people that are specially trained to guard the embassies thats a whole division with separate base separate training
there are almost 40 of them at every opening of my building plain clothes armed on the lookout changing shift and being relieved every two hours so they dont get bored
we have another group of a half a dozen seals team six guys and cia guys who are a counterterrorism unit that relate on a daily basis to homeland security the fbi and metro my company has metal detectors and devices at every entrance of the building for employees and guests that are nonvisible to the public we have done extraordinary things to make that sure we protect our employees and our guests at the hotel
surely other hotels in the city have installed major security too but again stephen paddock gets more than 10 suitcases filled with metal up to his suite without incident
and keeps them there for several days
here is a revealing nugget new york magazine october 6 he paddock was also a heavy drinker known to demand highend cognac and treat cocktail waitresses and his own girlfriend rudely according to a source in guest services at a casino he frequented
in other words paddock was aggressive casinos knew he was tightly wound he could go off on people this was a reason to hold him in suspicion but those 10 suitcases in his room not a cause for concern or question
if metal detectors are used at the mandalay hotel how did all that steel and weight slip through security was this an inside job did paddock have help from hotel security
at the moment the first window in paddocks suite was broken you would assume alarms would go off and hotel security would rush to the suite why have we heard nothing about this
take this one step further is it possible paddock was set up or was part of an operation whose ultimate objective was unknown to him is it possible some group with far more clout than paddock managed to get those suitcase into his suite
the mandalay hotel at this moment is doing everything it can to minimize and deflect blame for its lax security therefore how much hotel video of paddock can we expect to see in the coming days what cover stories will emerge what lies will be told what falsehoods will be promoted to defeat lawsuits filed against the hotel
las vegas will certainly try to allay tourist fears all the hotel and casino business in the city is on the line billions of dollars the people who make the lions share of that money will tell whatever lies they need to in order to keep up the appearance of tourist safety
final thought for the moment if security devices in the mandalay were turned off briefly to allow someone to bring in those suitcases full of weapons we are now talking about a sophisticated level of intrusion beyond the ability of stephen paddock how would the breach go unnoticed by the hotels full security detail how would the coverup of that breach have been rigged

"__label__fake water may hold the key to the mystery of the pyramids
 
for hundreds of years some of the brightest minds in history archaeology and even engineering have been baffled by one of the greatest mysteries the world has ever known
 
how did the ancient egyptians construct the astonishing pyramids of giza
 
this question has perplexed great minds for generations but now it is believed that historians are closer than ever to understanding how this ancient civilization managed to create such intricate and phenomenally large monoliths prior to the invention of the wheel and crane technology
 
according to stephen myers the founder of the pharaohs pump organization the answer could actually be very simple myers claims that the landscape surrounding the pyramids in giza was once very different to the arid desertstyle region that we see today
 
video series about how the great pyramid was built using water locks and barges
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the time of the ancient egyptians the evidence suggests that the area was surrounded by water and that this water was absolutely pivotal in the construction of the pyramids

growing proof that great pyramid may have been built by aliens
great pyramid sphinx may be 800000 years old after surviving great flood
 
herodotus widely regarded as the father of historical writing claimed that the giza plateau was once surrounded by water and that the area in close proximity to the great pyramid was home to an artificial dock in recent years archaeological evidence has pointed towards this description is correct
 
sediment laid by water has been discovered inside the pyramids and the great sphinx is also known to have endured a fairly significant level of water erosion over the centuries furthermore recent excavations in the region around the pyramid suggest that there was once a canal system which is likely to have been essential for the construction of the pyramids
 
one of the major mysteries regarding the construction of the pyramids is how the ancient egyptians managed to transport enormous stones which were quarried many miles away from the pyramid site prior to the invention of the wheel if the hypothesis regarding the presence of a body of water around the giza plateau is correct then this mystery may have been solved according to myers it seems highly probable that the ancient egyptians moved the stones from their original site to the pyramid plateau on specially created barges
 
these stones would have then been moved off the barge and laid on the construction site according to myers the pyramids would have been constructed in a slow and methodical manner with the outer casing stones being laid first followed by the interior stones as the workers began to construct the next layer of the pyramid they would use barges ladders and rudimentary lifting technology to move the stones into place they would continue in this way until the pyramid had been completed on all levels before finally placing the capstone on the very top of the pyramid
 
if this hypothesis is proven to be correct it would suggest that the construction of the pyramids was actually far more simple than historians and archaeologists have assumed for generations

new delhi reuters opecs secretary general mohammed barkindo on tuesday called on us shale oil producers to help curtail global oil supply warning extraordinary measures might be needed next year to sustain the rebalanced market in the medium to long term
we urge our friends in the shale basins of north america to take this shared responsibility with all seriousness it deserves as one of the key lessons learnt from the current unique supplydriven cycle said barkindo
the comments by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries official came during a speech delivered at the india energy forum organized by ceraweek in new delhi
at the moment we opec and independent us producers both agreed that we have a shared responsibility in maintaining stability because they are also not insulated from the impact of this downturn barkindo said referring to a slide in oil prices that spurred opec to agree production cuts late last year
related coverage opec says to reconvene meeting with us on deal to cut oil output
the call by independents themselves is that we need to continue this interaction he said
while opec and some other producers including russia have cut supplies this year in order to prop up prices us production has soared by almost 10 percent this year driven largely by shale drillers barkindo said he hoped that new producers not just us shale drillers would join production cuts
on monday saudi arabia cut crude oil allocations for november by 560000 barrels per day bpd in line with the kingdoms commitment to the supply reduction pact
demandsupply is returning to rebalance through massive destocking that we have been witnessing of stocks in oecd across regions in a very massive way barkindo said later speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the conference
in the past four months alone we have seen destocking to the tune of 130 million bpd he said
the aim of the opecled cut is to trim the level of oil in oecd industrialized countries compared with the fiveyear supply average barkindo said the stock overhang to the fiveyear average stood at 171 million barrels in august against 338 million at the start of the year
the speed and pace of destocking has accelerated as a result of anticipated and projected demand growth in the second half of 2017 to the tune of 2 million bpd we are witnessing a fast return to a balanced market barkindo said
still on sunday barkindo said opec and other oil producers might need to take some extraordinary measures next year to rebalance the oil market
world oil demand growth in 2017 is expected at 145 million barrels per day bpd and it should stay around 14 million bpd in 2018 barkindo said he said indias share of global oil demand is expected to rise to over 9 percent by 2040 up from 4 percent now"
"__label__real only 17 years old and he is already a recognised scientist muhammad shaheer niazis research on electric honeycomb was recently published in the royal society open science journal
physicists have known the phenomenon of electric honeycomb for decades it occurs when a layer of oil is placed in an electric field between a pointy electrode and a flat one and the instability caused by the buildup of ions applies pressure to the surface of the oil creating a beautiful pattern that looks like a honeycomb or a stained glass window
the high school student from pakistans city of lahore managed to photograph the movement of ions that forms the honeycomb besides recording the heat found on the surface of oil no one has done this before
electric honeycomb phenomenon was the problem given to him at the international young physicists tournament held in russia last year mr niazi and four other students made up the firstever team to represent pakistan at the tournament returning from russia mr niazi decided to get his research published
it took him another year of work to come up with novel ideas before his paper was finally accepted for publication he received the letter of acceptance just days ahead of his 17th birthday last month
your research is like your child and you feel out of this world when it is accepted for publication mr niazi tells the bbc in an interview at his residence in lahores posh sukh chayn sector
with the slim stature of a teenage boy with curly hair and spectacles sitting firmly on his nose the young scientist cuts a smart figure
seeking equilibrium
anticipating the first question he settles down on a couch next to a desk laden with boxes full of wires motherboards and incomplete circuits this is where he conducts his experiments
how is an electric honeycomb formed mr niazi elaborates electric honeycomb perfectly demonstrates how everything in this universe is seeking equilibrium its hexagonal shape is the most stable structure
in this case he says two electrodes are used a pointy needle on top of a flat surface with a thin layer of oil on it high voltage from the needle makes ions bombard the surface of the oil on their way to meet the ground electrode
it is just like lightning striking the surface of earth he says but oil is a nonconductor the ions start accumulating on the surface of the oil as the pressure increases they create a depression and manage to meet the ground electrode
in the process the surface of the oil loses its shape something it does not want so within no time honeycomblike hexagonal structures appear on the surface of the oil
the amount of energy that goes in equals the energy that comes out and thus the flow of electricity is efficient this way equilibrium is restored he sums up mr niazi replicated the phenomenon at last years tournament
to prove his findings he photographed the ion wind demonstrating that the ions were moving he also recorded the heat produced through their movement a finding that needs further study
he says he had been using the shadowgraphy technique just for fun before he decided to use it in his research i thought if i see my research from that perspective i might discover something new thats how i managed to photograph the shadow of ion wind and it was added as novelty in my paper
mr niazi says that using this technique an oil droplet can be manipulated without touching it engineers can use the visualisation of this phenomenon to develop technologies that can be used in biomedicine and in printing
in the country he comes from not many his age would dare venture into avenues of learning other than conventional schooling for shaheer niazi the traditional classroom learning became boring at times it was then that he turned to other avenues such as books he received from his father and grandfather
at a very young age he was also introduced to the concept of selflearning he was only 11 when he first started taking online courses he has taken 25 courses in different subjects from platforms like coursera for toys he owns a telescope and tools for his scientific experiments
when i was a child i used to watch documentaries on science with my grandfather and read books on mathematics and other science subjects says mr niazi
he has an inquisitive nature his mind is always abuzz with questions and then theories to explain them yet he too seeks equilibrium mr niazi has a deep interest in music and art he creates excellent pencil sketches and is a selftaught pianist
he was not expecting the media attention he is now getting but he is glad he did something that made his country proud he hopes to get into a reputable educational institution where he can further his research in physics
mr niazi aims big i would love to win another nobel prize for pakistan and he thinks bigger isaac newton was 17 when his first paper was published i was 16 when i officially received my acceptance letter"

last friday an oregon law went into effect that paves the way for the faster development of oregons hemp market and will further nullify federal prohibition in effect
sen ted ferrioli rjohn day introduced senate bill 1015 sb1015 last march the new law gives the oregon liquor control commission authority over the processing of industrial hemp under this regulatory scheme the states hemp business will be treated equally to the recreational cannabis industry
according to corvallis advocate this could open up new possibilities for the hemp industry subject to certain limitations
currently only registered hemp handlers can grow process and sell industrial hemp products in oregon according to seattles cannalaw group a legal firm providing support to several pot businesses in the northwest sb 1015 would create industrial hemp licensing for individuals already working in the legal weed business so that regular cannabis processors handlers and retailers could start to process and sell goods made out of hemp the biggest advantage of the new law would be that cbdexclusive products like extracts could be sold in recreational dispensaries thus lending even more of an edge to oregons booming cannabis economy
a recreational marijuana producer will have to register with the olcc before selling hemp products the law will also expand some plant testing and recordkeeping requirements
despite the additional requirements the new law should serve to expand the hemp industry in oregon
sb1015 passed the house by a 450 vote it passed the senate 263 with gov kate browns signature the law went into effect oct 6
the oregon legislature initially legalized industrial hemp production in 2009 when the oregon department of agriculture finally put its licensing and regulatory program in place early in 2014 some farmers began growing hemp despite high barriers to entry legislation passed in 2016 relaxed licensing requirements to encourage further development of a hemp market within the state the new law already shows signs of delivering on promises to further open up hemp production and processing in the state
the federal government still prohibits the cultivation of industrial hemp in most cases and it prohibits the commercial cultivation of hemp in all cases despite federal prohibition oregons current law sets the foundation for people to nullify the ban by encouraging hemp production in the state by relaxing regulations and facilitating further development of the hemp industry with this new law oregon will ultimately expand this illegal market
the evolution of the hemp program in oregon also demonstrates a practical reality tenth amendment center executive director michael boldin pointed out when states pass bills that remove a layer of law markets will inevitably begin to develop
as those markets take root legislators start feeling the pressure to relax laws further he said some critics complain that state licensing programs restrict freedom still staterestricted hemp farming is better than no hemp farming at all thats at least a little more freedom and as were seeing in oregon it ultimately opens the door to even freer markets down the road a little freedom begets more freedom
federal farm bill
early in 2014 president barack obama signed a new farm bill into law which included a provision allowing a handful of states to begin limited research programs growing hemp the hemp amendment
allows state agriculture departments colleges and universities to grow hemp defined as the nondrug oilseed and fiber varieties of cannabis for academic or agricultural research purposes but it applies only to states where industrial hemp farming is already legal under state law
in short current federal law authorizes the farming of hemp by research institutions or within state pilot programs for research only farming for commercial purposes by individuals and businesses remains prohibited oregon law ignores federal prohibition and authorizes commercial farming and production anyway
other states
by rejecting any need for federal approval states like oregon and others including colorado maine massachusetts california and vermont set the stage to nullify the federal hemp ban in practice by simply ignoring federal prohibition and legalizing industrial hemp production within their state borders
while prospective hemp growers still have to take federal law into consideration by eliminating the state requirement for federal permission these states clear away a major obstacle to widespread commercial hemp farming within the borders of the state as more people engage in hemp production and the market grows within these states more people will become emboldened creating an exponential wave ultimately nullifying the federal ban in effect
huge market for hemp
according to a 2005 congressional research service report the us is the only developed nation that hasnt developed an industrial hemp crop for economic purposes
experts suggest that the us market for hemp is around 600 million per year they count as many as 25000 uses for industrial hemp including food cosmetics plastics and biofuel the us is currently the worlds 1 importer of hemp fiber for various products with china and canada acting as the top two exporters in the world
during world war ii the united states military relied heavily on hemp products which resulted in the famous campaign and governmentproduced film hemp for victory

"__label__fake by joe giambrone
since december 2002 at the latest it became glaringly obvious that certain individuals in the us government had lied about how the 911 attacks had come to be when the bush administration censored the official congressional investigation the joint inquiry into the attacks notably the 28page section on foreign state funding to the named hijackers its legitimacy crumbled
with that first 911 investigation redacted and numerous questions outstanding the attack victims families pressed for a second investigation later to be known as the 911 commission key findings of this commission were falseor falsifiedas those now released 28 pages show
the public evidence against the saudis is partial and wasnt followedup on indicating internal pressures both before and after the attacks
one reason for the limited understanding is that it was only after september 11 that the us government began to aggressively investigate this issue prior to september 11th the fbi apparently did not focus investigative resources on redacted saudi nationals in the united states due to saudi arabias status as an american ally joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11th 2001 p415
senator bob graham its primary author has complained vociferously in the years since the bbc revealed a white house document telling us law enforcement to avoid investigating the saudis soon after the bush administration seized power in january 2001
after the elections the agencies were told to back off investigating the bin ladens and saudi royals and that angered agents greg palast bbc newsnight november 6 2001
the evidence of government malfeasance around the 911 attacks is not theoretical the joint inquiry implicates saudi agents who aided several of the named hijackers inside the us they are omar al bayoumi osama bassnan shaykh althumairy saleh alhussayen and abdullah bin laden the brother of osama prince bandar bin sultan bandar bush is also named throughout the report and supplied money to those named individuals further redactions plague the current version of the joint inquiry report which could potentially implicate others
they all walked free while 2996 civilians perished in the attacks and another 6000 were wounded over 4000 first responders have contracted cancer since due to the toxic environment of the aftermath
the 28 pages are a starting point not the end in 2005 three years later the cia inspector general under pressure released another damning report 
nawaf alhazmi and khalid almidhar were among the hijackers of 911 were known by the cia in early january 2000 to have traveled to kuala lumpur malaysia to participate in a meeting of suspected terrorists in january 2000 ctc officers received information that one of these suspected terrorists had a us visa in march 2000 these officers had information that the other had flown from bangkok to los angeles in the period january through march 2000 some 50 to 60 individuals read one or more of six agency cables containing travel information related to these terrorists emphasis added cia office of inspector general report 2005 page xiiixiv
the controversy concerns what the cia prefers to call information sharing with fbi but the counterterrorism advisor to the white house richard clarke has described this as cia deliberately hiding vital information from his office and from the fbi
unless someone intervened to stop the normal automatic distribution i would automatically get it there was not a lack of information sharing they told us everything except this emphasis added richard clarke terror czar 19922003
clarke was the highest counterterrorism official in america on 911 when he accused george tenet of hiding the terrorists from him and his staff the corporate media went silent rather than investigating these leads the cia denied everything and still clings to its mistakesweremade story the cias official incompetence story has all the key incompetents promoted rather than fired
several fbi agents desperate to prevent 911 also had direct dealings with cia operatives an fbi liaison to the cias counterterrorism center ctc doug miller drafted a memo to alert the fbi about hazmi and midhar coming to america but a cia superior blocked that cable from ever being sent
you follow terrorists halfway around the god damned globe you find out they have visas on their passport and you dont tell the fbi fbi agent mark rossini
beyond the cias obstruction of justice and arguably aiding and abetting terroristswhich would be treasonthe nsa also prevented its surveillance of al qaeda phone calls from ever reaching the us fbi agents on the case
between 2000 and 2001 as many as twenty calls were made between hazmi and midhar and a known al qaeda number in yemen the nsa never distributed this information to the fbi author lawrence wright the new yorker
enough deliberate obstruction allowed the 911 attacks to succeed that it is shocking how americans remain apathetic complacent and willfully ignorant of the known facts never mind the unknown story which remains coveredup a florida court is currently hiding 80000 pages of fbi surveillance of a mansion owned by a saudi family connected to the hijackers
to be clear these are 80k pages that were never seen by the house of representatives or senate to formulate their joint inquiry into 911 they were never seen by the 911 commission a supposedly independent body that was actually stuffed with conflicts of interest and insiders
multiple hijackers visited this sarasota mansion and yet for some reason the fbi has lied about their investigation of it the record remains classified to this day
so many clear red flags poke out of the official 911 story and yet the american people largely prefer comfortable myths to hard truths the propaganda has gotten so thick that you can now read opeds on cnn with absurd headlines like this congressional act jasta threatens us national security the author happened to be a saudi of course but more importantly nawaf obaid previously was special adviser to saudi prince turki al faisal
who is turki alfaisal
only the head of saudi intelligence the key man in the arrangement between that kingdom and osama bin laden cnn should be investigating the many links between turki alfaisal and alqaeda not giving faisals lackey free rein to mislead the american public
the 2002 congressional 911 investigation was declassified in 2016 after it had been officially coveredup for fourteen years during that time the us population swallowed the big lie then it went back to sleep
the public simply accepted myths and ignored facts particularly the fact of deliberate coverup of saudi official complicity in the attacks such a coverup is treason under the us constitution which has since become a dead letter
we entered the age of treason on the morning of september 11th 2001 and that crime has continued in broad daylight under three presidents hiding the fact of saudi arabian state complicity into an attack on america is aid and comfort to the enemy specific us officials should be arrested and tried still the saudi regime should be rightly considered the enemy of the people of the united states today as well as others
given these realities one would still be hardpressed to locate a single american citizen who actually read the 28 pages that prove saudi complicity in the greatest attack on america since pearl harborif not ever when historians recount the fall of america they will need to acknowledge the deliberate willful ignorance of the population in allowing it to happen
the america we find ourselves in today is divided and conquered it is in the interest of the people who wield power money media industry to provoke the common people into shouting about partisan politics and ignoring the workings of the deep state issues like 911 treason are brushed aside in favor of tenthousand more trivial things such as whatever donald trump last tweeted
the people have become negligent uninformed and overtly hostile to facts that challenge the dominant myths they have swallowed that is the crux of the game an information war of attrition propaganda resonates subtly across layers of society like skins of an onion regular people are compelled by social pressures to either accept the dominant myth of 911 and other government controversies labeled conspiracy theories or to shut up to avoid hostility and ridicule
the truth of matters like war and peace terror attacks and covert operations no longer interest the general public enough to invest time into understanding them ignorance won the public has been conditioned to look to their cell phones and to their corporate talking heads who provide them all the understanding required of cogs in a machine that machine is empire a belligerent state of perpetual warfare divorced from legal or moral restraint
when the facts of international provocations no longer interest the people who can restrain the empire then the elites in charge have gained a free hand to attack the next targets on their hit list since 911 we have seen us aggression and destabilization of afghanistan pakistan iraq libya syria yemen ukraine venezuela somalia and ongoing threats against north korea china and most dangerously russia
those are only the most obvious examples while in the shadows the us military sent its special forces into 138 countries it created africom to apply force to uncooperative african nations
by what right
the september 11th attacks provide a blanket perpetual casus belli for washington to target smaller nations around the globe on the pretext that those have some amorphous connection to terror that was the motive for the 911 attacks it was premeditated and admitted to in the project for the new american century document rebuilding americas defenses some key people wanted it and they committed treason to get it and to keep it covered up
one cannot rebuild americas defenses unless those defenses have somehow failed that failure was engineered to be a catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor far from a failure however the 911 attacks proved to be a rousing success for those invested in the militaryindustrial complex us military spending more than doubled in the subsequent years from 3017b in 2000 when their manifesto was written to more than 711b at its peak in 2011 the military budget dwarfs all other areas of us government spending and it is where americas wealth is redirected

"__label__real the weinstein companys board had a heated meeting on thursday night on friday three members of the board marc lasry dirk ziff and tim sarnoff resigned according to a board member and a company executive in a statement bob weinstein and three other board members said that a group of lawyers from debevoise plimpton including one with experience prosecuting sex crimes would lead an investigation into harvey weinsteins behavior
advertisement continue reading the main story
as harvey has said it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged the statement said next steps will depend on harveys therapeutic progress the outcome of the boards independent investigation and harveys own personal decisions
the weinstein brothers first came to prominence with miramax in 1989 the year they helped to activate the indiefilm boom with sex lies and videotape they sold miramax to disney in 1993 and left in 2005 to form the weinstein company they unsuccessfully dabbled in side businesses including a fashion label but eventually found their film footing with releases like inglourious basterds
photo
lately they have hit a dry spell although they have a fastgrowing television division the weinsteins have not had a mainstream hit at the north american box office since 2013 when lee daniels the butler took in 1166 million
so far this year the weinstein company a boutique studio that specializes in sophisticated smallbudget dramas like the 2011 oscar winner the kings speech has released six films which have taken in a combined 123 million at the domestic box office the biggest hit has been wind river a wellreviewed murder mystery that has collected about 33 million last year the weinsteins had seven films with combined ticket sales of just 65 million
to compare major studios like warner bros and the walt disney company generally take in 1 billion to 25 billion annually at the domestic box office
the weinstein company has also found itself sidelined at film festivals where mr weinstein has long shopped for movies to release helping to discover auteurs like quentin tarantino and steven soderbergh for years at the sundance film festival for instance his wallet was the only one that mattered to agents who would track his team relentlessly netflix and amazon dominate now
photo
at the same time a new cluster of independent movie companies some better financed and with more contemporary sensibilities arrived on the scene they include a24 which released the reigning oscar winner for best picture moonlight and megan ellisons annapurna pictures which has emerged as a favorite home for the kind of rebel filmmakers that mr weinstein used to have to himself
ms ellison whose films include american hustle and zero dark thirty has been one of the few hollywood executives willing to comment about the accusations against mr weinstein women face serious repercussions for sharing their experiences and deserve our full support she wrote on twitter on thursday with a link to the times report i admire the courage of these women
advertisement continue reading the main story
mr weinstein acknowledged in a statement on thursday that his behavior had caused a lot of pain and vowed to do better on friday a lawyer advising him lisa bloom said in a television appearance that he had acted inappropriately and agreed with an interviewer who characterized mr weinsteins reported actions as illegal and on saturday ms bloom said that she had resigned as an adviser to mr weinstein
mr weinsteins power in hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the academy awards he was at his height in the late 1990s when he drove films like shakespeare in love to bestpicture wins and huge ticket sales even in his more recent diminished state he remained a player prodding a tiny largely subtitled art film lion to six nominations this year the last time a weinstein film was a force at the oscars was in 2012 when the artist collected five awards including best picture
photo
in this years oscars cycle the companys big hopes are wind river and the current war a period drama about the rivalry between thomas edison and george westinghouse that is scheduled for a late november release it received a tepid response at last months toronto international film festival but mr weinstein has personally helped to reedit the movie since then
several agents and producers said that without mr weinsteins allornothing campaigning style those films would probably be stranded on the awards trail
as the movie business has become more difficult the weinsteins have found success in television especially the reality genre with heidi klums project runway that series runs on lifetime a division of ae networks and has spawned several spinoffs
series in development include a crime drama for amazon starring robert de niro and julianne moore and created by the director of silver linings playbook david o russell the weinstein company is also working with oliver stone on a series for showtime called guantánamo it has three major projects with the viacomowned paramount network including yellowstone a drama starring kevin costner and written by taylor sheridan the writerdirector behind wind river
amazon showtime ae and paramount all declined to comment about mr weinstein on friday or did not respond to queries ms klum mr sheridan and other people involved with weinstein company films and shows responded similarly
one prominent agent who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to draw his company into the controversy said that he would advise female clients against withdrawing from weinstein projects he quickly added however that he would also tell them to ask for a contract saying that they would have zero contact with harvey weinstein"

 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
while the playoff committee doesnt rank the power 5 conference there is no way conference strength which means ooc results doesnt figure in to a committee members thought process
let me point out on my philosophy on these rankings your most recent ooc results count a lot and youll see me reference that throughout the season
well give each conference a relative strength value 110
let me explain my relative rankings
05 conference lacks depth no elite teams
67 conference lacks depth and there are 12 elite teams and 12 quality teams
78 at least 2 elite teams and at least 2 quality teams
89 3 elite teams and at least 2 quality teams
910 12 of conference is elite andor quality teams
1 big 10 75
i decided to move the big 10 to the top spot because with so little separating the conferences i do think the big 10 is the most top heavy with penn state wisconsin michigan and ohio state
next week michigan faces rival michigan state penn state plays northwestern and wisconsin plays nebraska im not ready to place ohio state back in the playoff chase just yet
playoff contenders
penn state
in the playoff picture
wisconsin michigan
2 acc 74
the acc didnt suffer any ooc losses and has 5 ranked this week teams to lead all conferences clemson is firmly planted as one of the countrys elite team after their win at virginia tech
miami plays at florida state this week and if the canes are serious about being an acc contender or more theyll beat a clearly down fsu team clemson plays wake forest at home

3 sec 73
when one of your ranked teams like lsu loses to troy at home your conference is going to take a hit right now alabama is great georgia and auburn look good but beyond that the conference is a mess
alabama plays at texas am this week and georgia heads to vanderbilt both will remain right in the playoff chases after those games
playoff contenders
alabama

georgia
4 pac 12 72
usc went to down to washington state which knocked them out of the playoff chase for now for me that drops the pac 12 down a few notches washington looks like the pac 12s best playoff chance

unless a group of 5 or independent team can reach the top 15 theres not much to note outside the power 5 in terms of the playoff

my current playoff teams
as my personal criticism of the playoff committee i dont think the top 4 seeds order should be released until the final rankings the playoff committees inconsistent and ever changing criteria is causing unnecessary frustration and confusion its one of the improvement points id have for them
if i had a vote this is who i would put in the playoff right now
in oklahoma alabama clemson washington

the strength of the emp is determined by the height at which it is created such an emp would have devastating consequences it would destroy our electrical grid all of our critical civilian infrastructure would be devastated as well there would be no food no water no hospitals no communications
 
those events may be alarming but they would be survivable by most the real danger of an emp event lies elsewhere it is a danger that turns an emp into an ele an extinction level event its a threat not many dare to mention only whispered about in certain circles and some of the more serious survivalist blogs
 
that danger is posed by our nuclear power plants littered across the country the united states has over 100 nuclear power plants scattered around the nation nuclear power plants are depedant on the main grid all of those facilities would quickly go into meltdown as their back up systems fail the time frame would be anything from 24 hours to four weeks

my shoulder started to hurt in the practice which didnt help either and once i lost the first set i was just not strong enough to continue because ive not eaten much in the past 24 hours he added
im hoping to be okay for the doubles and will make a decision tomorrow morning hopefully off of a good nights sleep which i didnt get last night

today a new hampshire law that prohibits the state department of education and the state board of education from requiring any school or school district to implement common core standards goes into effect this represents an opportunity for local communities to opt out of common core and nullify the program in practice
a coalition of republicans introduced senate bill 44 sb44 in january the legislation opens the door to to end common core in the state by prohibiting the department of education and the board of education from requiring schools to implement common core standards
neither the department of education nor the state board of education shall by statute or rule require that the common core state standards developed jointly by the national governors association center for best practices and the council of chief state school officers be implemented in any school or school district in this state
in addition sb44 prohibits the state board of education from amending existing academic standards or approving new standards without prior review and recommendation of an education legislative oversight committee
the house passed sb44 by a voice vote the senate passed it with a 149 vote with gov chris sununus signature the law is effective as of sept 16
this is a first step toward unraveling common core in new hampshire while it will not immediately end the program or require school districts to abandon it it allows for local decisionmaking school districts that want to abandon the national standards are now free to do so
history
common core was intended to create nationwide education standards while touted as a state initiative through the national governors association nga and the council of chief state school officers ccsso the us department of education was heavily involved behind the scenes up until recently the doe tied the grant of waivers from the no child left behind act to adoption of common core using the standards as powerful strings to influence state educational policy the every student succeeds act passed by congress in 2015 now prohibits the doe from attempting to influence incentivize or coerce state adoption of the common core state standards or any other academic standards common to a significant number of states but under the new federal law states still must comply with college and career ready standards based on common core as a condition for receiving some federal dollars it also requires the federal education secretary to approve each states plans for standards and assessments
even with the federal strings partially cut from common core for the time being it is still imperative for each state to adopt its own standards the feds can once again use these national standards to meddle in state education at any time if they remain in place just as importantly onesizefitsall standard simply dont benefit children state and local governments should remain in full control of their own educational systems
rejecting nationalized education standards is the first step toward bringing true academic choice and freedom passage of this legislation into law represents a positive step forward for the people of new hampshire and a path for other states to follow"
"__label__real rio de janeiro thomson reuters foundation a brazilian activist on tuesday won a top international honor for her long fight against a giant hydroelectric dam in the amazon rainforest that has forced tens of thousands of indigenous people from their homes
antonia melo is the first brazilian to receive the alexander soros foundation award for environmental and human rights activism designed to expose the impacts of projects such as the belo monte dam on the xingu river
the project which will be one of the worlds largest hydroelectric dams will flood a swathe of biodiverse rainforest inhabited by the indigenous xinguense people
this award will strengthen and shed light on our fight against this dam melo told the thomson reuters foundation
melo 64 has been campaigning against the dam for more than two decades born in brazils northeast region she moved to the amazon region where the dam is being built when she was 4 years old
i consider myself a xinguense she said
belo monte is the largest and most highprofile of an estimated 100 hydropower projects planned for the brazilian amazon
some 40000 people from small riverside communities have already been forced from their homes by the project twice as many as were projected before construction began in 2011 melo said
evictions are a very violent process that will remain in our hearts forever she said
a federal court in september suspended again the operating license for the dam saying norte energia the consortium running the project did not comply with commitments made when it won the bid
a brasiliabased court ordered further construction halted until the consortium meets commitments to provide adequate housing for those driven from their homes
norte energia has denied that it has failed to provide adequate housing and said it is complying with all commitments made when it won the tender
alexander soros founder of the alexander soros foundation said the award aims to shed light on the potentially damaging impact of megaprojects that could be more environmentally catastrophic than are logging and mining operations

"__label__real but the deliberate slowtalking oil executive has little personal chemistry with the quicktalking impulsive mr trump mr tillerson has avoided expressing his pique to the president but aides and trump associates who have been in the room with them said mr tillersons body language eye rolling and terse expressions left little doubt that he disapproves of mr trumps approach
mr trump they said has noticed how mr tillerson slouches in his presence particularly when he disagrees with a decision when overruled mr tillerson often says its your deal to the presidents irritation according to two former administration officials
mr tillerson felt compelled on wednesday to address the internal schism after nbc news reported that he had been prepared to step down this summer until he was talked out of it and that after a meeting of national security officials at the pentagon he had derided mr trump as a moron vice president mike pence at one point counseled mr tillerson on how to ease tension with the president according to the report
theres never been a consideration in my mind to leave mr tillerson told reporters i serve at the appointment of the president and i am here for as long as the president feels i can be useful to achieving his objectives
asked directly if he had called mr trump a moron mr tillerson would not say im not going to deal with petty stuff like that he said
when that left the impression that it was true a state department spokeswoman heather nauert appeared before reporters hours later to deny it on his behalf he did not say that she said
the spectacle left the state department paralyzed in the moments leading up to mr tillersons statement hallways in the departments cavernous headquarters were nearly deserted as diplomats were glued to televisions wondering whether he would join the parade of top trump administration officials who have resigned

indeed the news conference was the latest rupture in an administration consumed by palace intrigue from the start just last week tom price resigned as secretary of health and human services after being publicly scolded by mr trump for using chartered flights mr trump has lost a chief of staff a national security adviser a chief strategist a press secretary and two communications directors he has fired the fbi director belittled his attorney general and publicly assailed the deputy attorney general

that turnover is one reason mr trump has not pushed mr tillerson out according to advisers speaking with reporters in las vegas mr trump dismissed the report that mr tillerson considered resigning it was fake news he said its a totally phony story asked about the secretary mr trump said total confidence in rex i have total confidence
but even as mr tillerson denied a rift with the president on wednesday he alluded to significant differences over north korea and iran he stressed a peaceful resolution of the nuclear dispute with north korea and associated himself with mr mattis who just a day earlier endorsed retaining the nuclear agreement with iran that mr trump has threatened to rip up
president trumps america first agenda has given voice to millions who felt completely abandoned by the political status quo and who felt their interests came second to those of other countries he said president trumps foreign policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think is achievable on behalf of our country
senator bob corker republican of tennessee and the chairman of the foreign relations committee expressed hope that mr tillerson would not leave because he serves as a check on instability i think secretary tillerson secretary mattis and chief of staff kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos and i support them very much he said
but others said it was time for him to go rex tillerson has been dealt a bad hand by the potus has played it badly richard n haass a state department official for republican presidents and now the president of the council on foreign relations wrote on twitter using the initials for president of the united states for both reasons he cannot be effective secstate should resign
mr tillerson has been frustrated for months not just by mr trumps unpredictable policy positions but by his provocative leadership style he publicly distanced himself when mr trump blamed both sides for violence at a white supremacist rally in charlottesville va and bristled when the president gave a political speech to the boy scouts of america an organization mr tillerson once headed nbc reported that he was so offended by the boy scouts speech that he threatened not to return to washington from a visit to texas
the episode that mr tillerson called a real breaking point according to associates came when he was trying to mediate a dispute between the persian gulf state of qatar and its arab neighbors the secretary had long told colleagues that relationships he built over decades in business made him uniquely qualified to broker a deal
but he complained bitterly that he was undermined by mr trump and mr trumps soninlaw jared kushner whom he accused of siding with the united arab emirates when mr tillerson publicly called for a calm and thoughtful dialogue the president less than an hour later lashed out at qatar as a financier of terrorism
advertisement continue reading the main story
mr tillerson was also angry with stephen k bannon then the presidents chief strategist whom he accused of planting negative news stories including a report that the secretary had dressed down a white house official johnny destefano in the west wing during that same meeting mr tillerson groused to white house officials about mr trumps tweets describing them as counterproductive to his efforts at diplomacy according to a person with direct knowledge
his aides also have been looking over their shoulders at nikki r haley the ambassador to the united nations who is seen as a probable replacement if mr tillerson leaves r c hammond mr tillersons spokesman told nbc that mr pence had asked mr tillerson if ms haley was helpful to the administration
mr hammond on wednesday said he spoke out of line about conversations i wasnt privy to and a spokesman for mr pence said any suggestion that the vice president questioned ms haleys value was categorically false"

berlin reuters germany is worried that us president donald trump will decide this week that iran is not respecting a twoyearold deal to curb its nuclear programme and fears such a step will worsen the security situation in the middle east
foreign minister sigmar gabriel said germany was prepared to work with the united states to change irans behaviour in the region but we do not want to see this agreement damaged
we are looking with great concern towards the united states gabriel told reporters in berlin
we urge the white house not to call into question such an important achievement that has improved our security he said in reference to the 2015 accord reached under trumps predecessor barack obama who sought detente with tehran
we are also offering to help influence irans behaviour in the region germany is ready to do this but not at the price of sacrificing the nuclear deal
trump is expected to decertify the landmark agreement between iran and britain china france germany russia the united states and european union despite advice from senior members of his own cabinet and us partners to stick with it
if he does say iran is not respecting the deal the us congress would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions that were lifted in exchange for curbs on irans nuclear programme
even if congress does not take that step the deal could be at risk of unravelling if washington and tehran resort to titfortat retaliatory steps
the un nuclear watchdog has repeatedly certified that iran is in compliance with the deals terms
gabriel called the accord a great diplomatic success saying it had prevented iran from developing nuclear weapons and headed off a military conflict between iran and israel
we are worried based on the signals coming out of the united states that the president will tell lawmakers that the nuclear deal with iran is not being fulfilled gabriel said this runs counter to the view of all the european countries that participated in the deal as well as the eu
gabriel said he had made clear to us secretary of state rex tillerson in recent conversations that europe due to its relative geographical proximity to iran would see its own security interests as damaged if the nuclear deal collapsed
he also drew attention to the signal such a step would send to north korea
our big concern with regard to north korea is that it is very unlikely that the north korean dictatorship would sign an international agreement in which it agrees to renounce nuclear weapons when the one agreement like this with iran is being called into question gabriel said"

"__label__real brussels reuters the european union will cut back contacts with myanmars top generals in a first step to increase sanctions over an army offensive that has driven more than 500000 rohingya muslims out of the country according to a draft document seen by reuters
thousands of the rohingya fled for myanmar to bangladesh on monday in a new surge of refugees driven by fears of starvation and violence which the united nations denounced as ethnic cleansing
the united states and the european union have been considering targeted sanctions against myanmar military leaders though the european bloc sees its options as relatively limited with no hardhitting direct leverage on the ground
eu foreign ministers will discuss the situation in myanmar on oct16 and their draft joint statement said the bloc will suspend invitations to the commanderinchief of the myanmarburma armed forces and other senior military officers
the text which will be discussed further by envoys from the 28 eu states on tuesday and may be modified said the eu may consider further measures depending on developments in myanmar but would respond accordingly to positive developments
the document confirmed support for an existing eu embargo on arms and equipment that can be used for internal repression
it called on myanmar to discuss repatriating refugees from neighboring bangladesh and praised the latter for its role in the crisis which started when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts brought a ferocious military response

refugees and rights groups say the army and buddhist vigilantes use killing and arson to drive the rohingya out of myanmar myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing
the eu draft characterized the situation in the mostaffected rakhine state as extremely serious and said kachin and shan provinces were also of great concern
it called on all sides to cease violence told the military to end its operations and protect all civilians equally as well as calling on myanmar to allow humanitarian access to the affected regions
the west has invested politically in myanmar leader and nobel peace laureate aung san suu kyi who has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence
while the eu feels disillusioned it also acknowledges aung san suu kyi has little influence over myanmars security forces
the move to punish the army head is largely symbolic as the west is also wary of hurting the wider economy or destabilizing alreadytense ties between suu kyi and the army
its leverage on the ground fades compared to that of myanmars immediate neighbors including china

"__label__real london reuters breakingviews sky shareholders face a choice between principles and profit some investors are planning to oppose chairman james murdochs reelection because he is also chief executive of 39 percent owner twentyfirst century fox but kicking up a stink might further jeopardise foxs offer for the european paytv group
sky investor royal london asset management had a point last week when it called murdochs dual role inappropriate and said shareholders would be better served by a truly independent chairman during the takeover shareholder advisory groups meanwhile object to skys executive pay one problem is that some longterm incentive packages could pay out with no performance conditions if foxs offer gets the green light according to glass lewis
murdoch survived an investor backlash last year winning election with around 70 percent support strip out foxs stake and abstentions however and just half of skys independent shareholders backed the chairman
concerns about conflicts of interest are more pressing this time foxs bid is on ice until at least march 2018 while uk authorities study its effects on the countrys media ownership and broadcasting standards sky investor crispin odey has argued that the delays are beginning to make the offer look on the low side
that logic is questionable when it was launched in december 2016 foxs offer of 1075 pounds per share represented a 40 premium to skys market value the shares would probably fall to around 8 pounds if the bid is blocked notwithstanding their concerns about murdochs independence most sky shareholders would bite foxs hands off if they got a chance to vote on the bid
that is why investors might hesitate before lodging a protest vote as long as fox and the murdoch family are under a regulatory microscope campaigners have argued that past sexual harassment and phonehacking scandals in the murdoch empire are grounds for blocking the takeover drawing attention to the familys governance shortcomings could add to the political pressure on uk media secretary karen bradley who must rule on the deal sky shareholders have legitimate complaints but those thinking with their wallets may decide to keep quiet"

beirut reuters irans moderate president gave a fullthroated defense of his onetime rivals in the revolutionary guards on wednesday as the countrys pragmatist and hardline factions rallied together in the face of threats from donald trump
the us president is expected to decertify irans nuclear deal with global powers this week and add its revolutionary guards military force to washingtons black list of terrorist groups under a strategy to increase pressure on tehran
the threat of us action has united the two main factions of irans leadership with the pragmatists led by president hassan rouhani who seek greater openness to the west demonstrating their support for the hardline guards
during a cabinet meeting shown on state television on wednesday rouhani said us action against the guards would be a mistake beyond mistakes
they think that the guards are a military entity the revolutionary guards are not a military entity theyre in the heart of the people the revolutionary guards in all the days of danger have defended our national interests he said
were one society were iran there are no differences between different factions in confronting the plots of our enemies he added
rouhani the architect of irans 2015 deal with global powers to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions won reelection in a landslide five months ago on a platform promising greater openness to the world and reform at home
during an unprecedentedly bitter campaign he repeatedly spoke out in public against the political influence of the guards accusing them of backing his hardline opponent to defend their economic interests
in recent days however the threat of new action from washington has prompted a public display of unity from the rival factions among irans rulers
today the president of america has created conditions where iran is more united than ever today those who oppose the nuclear deal and those who support it are side by side we all have one voice rouhani said
newspapers on tuesday ran pictures of the urbane useducated foreign minister javad zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the guards majorgeneral mohammad ali jafari
zarif brief lawmakers on wednesday about the expected us action and about irans plans for a response according to members of parliament quoted in state media
crushing response
in the closed session zarif emphasized that if the americans take any steps against the nuclear deal that the islamic republic of iran will give them a more crushing response shahbaz hassanpour a lawmaker representing the city of sirjan told the islamic republic news agency irna
lawmakers did not disclose the specific actions that zarif had discussed as plans for iranian retaliation
trumps expected move to decertify the nuclear deal would not by itself withdraw the united states from the agreement but would pass that decision on to congress requiring lawmakers to decide within 60 days whether to reimpose sanctions
the nuclear deal is supported by washingtons european allies britain france and germany as well as by russia and china all of which say iran has complied so far
adding the guards to the terrorism blacklist could have economic consequences since the elite military force also has a vast business empire in iran international banks are required to make sure their clients are not blacklisted
washington has already blacklisted other entities and individuals for supporting guards activities but has not yet blacklisted the guards themselves
during the meeting with zarif parliament members expressed their support for the guards hassanpour said zarif also noted during the session that european countries will continue backing the nuclear deal regardless of what actions the us may take hassanpour told irna"

"__label__real new york reuters a texasbased chain of strip clubs would go on a buying spree a growing technology company would move fewer jobs overseas and a regional bank would boost its spending on cybersecurity
these are some of the uses of the tax savings that small and mediumsized us companies say they would pursue if the trump administration and the republicancontrolled congress slashed corporate taxes as promised
small companies pay the highest taxes and they would be the main beneficiaries of such a trump windfall reuters contacted the 100 largest companies by market value in the benchmark russell 2000 index of us small and midcap stocks as well as another 50 in the russell 2000 with no analyst coverage none of the 17 companies that responded to reuters queries mentioned boosting their headcount
the administration has said the tax cuts would largely pay for themselves by spurring more investment and creating jobs
but companies say they look to spend on technology that will allow them to improve productivity or make acquisitions rather than hire more workers
we want to be a company of the future and technology is one of the key ingredients said keith cargill chief executive at dallasbased texas capital bankshares inc tcbio a bank with a market value of 42 billion the tax cut would be a huge plus for earnings cargill said but with little impact on the banks workforce
the russell 2000 companies tend to pay the highest effective tax rates now an average of 319 percent according to thomson reuters data and would stand to gain the most if corporate taxes are cut to 20 percent from 35 percent as the trump administration has proposed
for large companies in the sp 500 the average effective tax rate is 28 percent a reflection of a greater share of overseas business and more leeway in reducing their tax rates
while few companies would discuss any details in public before outlining them to their shareholders executives chief financial officers and treasures say they are already starting to formulate plans for a tax windfall even if they are not certain whether and in what form it will pass
neil hennessy the chief executive of novato californiabased hennessy advisors inc hnnao a mutual fund company told reuters he was in acquisition mode and would keep looking for targets in the event of a tax cut passing
strip clubs and share buybacks
one of the first firms to publicly discuss a potential tax windfall is rci hospitality holdings inc ricko a chain of 40 strip clubs headquartered in houston texas its chief executive eric scott langan told analysts on aug 9 that a tax cut would allow him to buy more clubs and boost the share price which he complained failed to reflect the firms organic growth
the exterior of ricks cabaret steakhouse is seen in new york city us october 7 2017 reutersstephanie keith
i think thats going to change and i think thats when youre going to see the multiple expansion come into play he said during an earnings call
the tax cut would also affect companies which do not pay taxes now either because they are not yet profitable or are using past losses to offset their tax bills
paul auvil the chief financial officer at cybersecurity company proofpoint inc pfpto said that the 4 billion marketcap company expects to start paying taxes in 2021 when it no longer be able to offset past losses
by then the corporate tax rate would need to sink at least below 27 percent auvil told reuters otherwise proofpoint would move its intellectual property to an offshore company in europe where corporate taxes are lower which would mean hiring up to 100 back office staff there said
these are jobs that have every reason to be in the us but it will require tax reform
the prospects of a tax cut have helped push the ishares russell 2000 etf iwmp up about 10 percent over the last six weeks compared with a 37 percent gain in the fund which tracks sp 500 spx
if the tax package does pass large companies will be more likely to buy back their own stock while smaller firms will probably reinvest in their businesses said tom forte an analyst at new york based da davidson
these companies are going to take every incremental cost savings from a tax cut and invest it to keep up with the amazons amzno and ubers forte said
for instance forte expects ebay inc ebayo to spend most of the possible windfall on increasing its stock buyback program a smaller company like yelp inc yelpn would probably invest in artificial intelligence technology to better harness its websites advertising potential he said
grubhub inc grubn meanwhile would spend more on its service that delivers from restaurants that do not have their own delivery staff forte said while groupon inc grpno would invest more in marketing and advertising
some smaller companies are also considering share buybacks rather any significant changes to their capital allocation
thomas castellano treasurer at drug delivery company catalent inc ctltn told reuters that the 52 billion company would keep spending on maintaining its 35 locations around the globe and look for possible acquisitions any extra money would go to share buybacks and catalent was unlikely to increase its hiring rate if a tax cut passes castellano said
we wouldnt be adding to our headcount because that would affect our margins at a time when we would otherwise see them improving"

"__label__real and yet the cowboys defense has not forced a takeaway in three consecutive games and it has yielded scores on 14 of 18 possessions six touchdowns eight field goals excluding the rams kneeldown at the end of that game dallass offense has scored on seven of its last eight firsthalf possessions across these past two losses but has sputtered after halftime managing two touchdowns and a field goal even when dallas did score in the second half sunday going ahead late by 3128 it mismanaged the clock
given 73 seconds and a timeout to guide green bay into fieldgoal range rodgers thought it better just to keep on going to throw for a touchdown and finish the darn thing and because he is aaron rodgers that is what he does
can i say the f word said dallas defensive lineman david irving when asked to convey the difficulty of defending rodgers quickly adding with a chuckle that guy is awesome at what he does it takes everybody to stop one guy
that is both a platitude and a keen bit of insight as precise a passer as rodgers is when throwing from the pocket all the cowboys wanted sunday was to contain him there the danger he poses when he scrambles when he improvises can be measured by his absurd 35yard sideline completion on third and 20 that set up the winning field goal in last seasons divisional playoff round
but that was then and the cowboys are loath to discuss last season its behind them and all that if they were destroying teams instead of getting clobbered by denver and blowing halftime leads to green bay and the rams and if their offensive line were creating those same wide creases for elliott instead of being manhandled across the first three quarters sunday and if they were zipping toward 133 again instead of explaining three defeats in five games they might be more likely to elaborate on those comparisons
since they are not the cowboys were left to address less appealing things such as how their offensive highlight of the game the goahead drive that took 17 plays and consumed 843 of the fourth quarter came to unmoor them it was the last two plays of that drive that seemed to haunt jones afterward
on second and 2 from the green bay 11 with 1 minute 24 seconds left prescott threw an incomplete fade to dez bryant had the cowboys run they would have forced green bay to take its final timeout or at the least drained another 35 or 40 seconds off the clock

prescott then faked a handoff and ran for a touchdown he could have slid at the 1yard line wasting more time and giving dallas first and goal and four chances to breach the goal line

passing up a touchdown in that situation would have run counter to prescotts instincts its important to get in the end zone and put the pressure on them he said and coach jason garrett said afterward that he agreed with prescotts decision
jones appeared less certain
what we all wanted to do was to keep the ball away from him but obviously we need to score a touchdown he said referring to rodgers well be secondguessing those last two calls and i know you will as well for a long time
the clock showed 113 as expected the packers said afterward they were confident that they would score and the cowboys said they were confident that they would prevent rodgers from scoring but had the fans been polled they almost certainly would have deemed the outcome as inevitable
it looked really easy said receiver davante adams who caught two of rodgerss three touchdown passes sometimes its not always as easy as it looks but he makes it look that way
the best players display their brilliance in ways overt and subtle and on third and 8 from the cowboys 30 and with the pocket collapsing rodgers slipped free from benson mayowa and rolled left where he felt irvings arms around his ankles
photo
in the past that effort might have been enough to bring down rodgers but he has been ever more cognizant of his running style how sometimes he does not pick his knees up which leaves him susceptible to getting tackled from behind highstepping out of the tackle rodgers scampered for 18 yards to the dallas 12
on the next play rodgers couldnt connect on a fade to adams covered by jourdan lewis but he and adams shared a glance lets do it again adams told rodgers the quarterback amended the formation and the ball was over lewiss head and into adamss hands before lewis could even turn
he threw it exactly where it had to be lewis said
lewis a rookie had three pass deflections in an otherwise excellent game but in tone and in substance his lament was familiar
advertisement continue reading the main story
once again the cowboys could not stop rodgers once again they staggered in the second half once again they scored 30 points and gained more than 400 yards and still lost according to the nfl the rest of the league combined has two such losses
dallas has yet to play atlanta kansas city oakland or seattle or division rivals philadelphia and washington twice next week the cowboys get a reprieve
the bye allows teams to reflect and assess all that has gone wrong and right the cowboys are bound to examine a running attack whose early struggles have put more of an onus on prescott and a defense that buckles at the games pivot points
how the cowboys perform when they return on oct 22 against the winless 49ers will help reshape their season at least they will not score four touchdowns at home and lose the game is in san francisco"
"__label__fake sunday morning start em or sit em wayne gallman davante adams melvin gordon more
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
just hours before the start of week 5 i know many people have questions running through their heads who should i start who should i sit lets take a look at how some of the recent news changes things
wayne gallman new york giants running back
paul perkins was ruled out for this week and after missing week 4 its possible that orleans darkwa is limited assuming he returns that clears an opportunity for gallman who looked more impressive than perkins and darkwa have at any time this season in week 4
11 carries for 42 yards he also caught 2 passes including 1 for a td
this could be gallmans opportunity to seize the job moving forward and he has a favorable matchup to do so the chargers who are traveling to the east coast for an early game are allowing the eighth most points per week to opposing running backs due to a league leading 611 rushing yards they were also torched by legarrette blount a week ago who took 16 carries for 136 yards while gallman isnt quite a trustworthy option hes a viable flex and potentially a rb2
verdict borderline rb2 solid flex
legarrette blount philadelphia eagles running back
speaking of blount he should get a lot of touches again this week with wendell smallwood likely out he does not have an ideal matchup with arizona having allowed just 277 rushing yards to opposing rb on the season they are traveling east for an early game however so there is a little bit of hope hes more of a risky flex play given the matchup though it all comes down to your alternatives
verdict potential flex play

rishard matthews tennessee titans wide receiver
according to adam schefter via twitter
titans qb marcus mariota considered gametime decision due to hamstring not expected to play vs dolphins per source matt cassel starts
obviously mariota needs to be benched the question is what impact does his absence have on the skill players around him you would think they will go with a run based attack meaning both demarco murray and derrick henry get a slight boost in value
the impact is on matthews who was viewed as a borderline wr2 entering the week as it is his numbers arent very impressive turning 32 targets into just 17 receptions 250 yards and 1 td with the downgrade in qb hes barely on the wr3 spectrum and should be avoided due to the downside risk
verdict sit unless absolutely desperate
melvin gordon san diego chargers running back
its been a disappointing season for gordon though he had a big week 3 against the chiefs 17 carries for 79 yards and 1 td and this could be a nice rebound week gordon was quoted by espns eric williams after week 4 click here for the article as saying
im super frustrated at the moment but i cant let it break me gordon said after the game it all falls under the same thing but obviously not getting the touches and not getting the win the win is the biggest thing but then the fact that you feel like you cant even help youre just kind of sitting back it sucks because i just feel like im kind of helpless back there
look for the chargers to try and feed him the ball this week especially against a giants defense thats averaging 45 yardscarry to opposing running backs while the giants defense could be stout against the run this is a must play situation
verdict must play in all formats
davante adams green bay packers wide receiver
according to rob demvsky via twitter
davante adams is traveling to dallas and has cleared the concussion protocol per source hes expected to play
it will be interesting to see if hes limited in any way but the cowboys are a solid matchup in a game that should be a bit of a shootout while the risk does knock adams down a bit consider him a potential wr2 and a must use wr3 at worst
verdict potential wr2 depending on your alternatives
amari cooper oakland raiders wide receiver
cooper has been practicing and was removed from the injury report but does that make him a trustworthy option everything seems to be working against him
derek carr is likely to miss the game the matchup is poor with the ravens allowing the fourth fewest points per week to opposing wide receivers cooper has been miserable turning 31 targets into 12 receptions and 110 yards plus his lone td came in week 1
if you are desperate for a wr3 then maybe but in most cases the risk outweighs the potential reward
verdict wr3 at best

jamaal williamsaaron jones green bay packers running back
ty montgomery was listed as doubtful opening things up for green bays pair of rookie running backs to step up the question is who is the better option for fantasy owners dallas defense has been far more susceptible to opposing running backs who can catch the football
rushing 357 yards 1 td
receiving 30 receptions 272 yards 2 td
neither of green bays rookies have displayed much in that regard quite yet and they will likely share the touches nearly equally unless someone gets hot early in other words its a gamble regardless and unless you are desperate its one to avoid
verdict desperation flex play but far too unpredictable
elijah mcguire new york jets running back
matt forte has been ruled out leaving mcguire and bilal powell to share the backfield thats going to lead many to jump on the mcguire bandwagon though hes going to continue to play second fiddle he got 12 touches a week ago and thatll be right around where wed expect him to be 812 touches is a good estimate while the matchup may not scare you with limited touches and the unlikelihood that he matches the explosiveness from week 4 131 yards and 1 td hes going to be a tough player to trust
verdict borderline flex play but not a must start
john brown arizona cardinals wide receiver
adam schefter tweeted this morning that cardinals wr john brown listed as questionable due to quad injury is expected to play sunday vs eagles per source considering a favorable matchup you would think that would put brown on the map but the risks still outweigh the rewards
will he be limited in terms of snaps when hes on the field how often will he be targeted with larry fitzgerald jaron brown and jj nelson all in the mix theres general risk for a west coast team traveling east and playing an early game
verdict sit em as risks outweigh the potential rewards
dak prescott dallas cowboys quarterback
on the fence about utilizing prescott this week against green bay you shouldnt be after he posted a pair of strong performances against them a year ago 549 yards 6 td 2 int just to make things even more attractive look at this stat about the packers defense courtesy of espns matthew berry
since the start of last season opponents have completed 69 percent of passes and scored 289 points per game at home against them compared to 614 and 190 at lambeau
this game could easily be a shootout so consider prescott a solid qb1 in all formats

"__label__real climate change may cause nearly three times as much clearair turbulence as current conditions by the period between 2050 and 2080 according to a study released today
flights over the north atlantic may experience as much as 180 percent more severe turbulence or inflight bumpiness stronger than gravity and able to shake passengers in a planes cabin according to the study published in the geophysical research letters journal flights over north america may experience an additional 110 percent and flights over europe up to 160 percent more
what air travelers can expect is to be confined to their seat for a lot longer in the future because the seat belt sign will have to be on for two times or maybe three times longer paul williams a professor of atmospheric science at the university of reading in the uk and the lead author of the study told abc news
previous research has shown that clearair turbulence which occurs without a visual warning like clouds or thunderstorms and is usually at high altitudes is on the rise but scientists had only zeroed in on transatlantic flights traveling at about 39000 feet in the winter
this study using multiple computer climate models found that turbulence is on the rise worldwide yearround and at different altitudes
university of reading
focusing on the invisible clearair turbulence researchers found that global temperature changes would lead to rougher more frequent air pockets at higher altitudes in the jet streams narrow bands of powerful winds tens of thousands of feet above the earths surface
the study authors say that turbulence is one of the largest causes of weatherrelated aviation accidents and clearair turbulence has been found to account for about 24 percent of weatherrelated accidents turbulence is also one of the main causes of flightattendant injuries they added
more turbulence in the future could lead to an increase in air passenger and flightattendant injuries unless scientists ability to forecast turbulence improves williams said
i think well see more injuries in the future even if the number of people flying is constant which of course its not he said thats going up too
since many of the planes that will be used by 2050 havent yet been built researchers say aircraft design and turbulence detection technology could help reduce the effects on passengers of the future"
"__label__fake carl sagan went to the st thomas dolphin point laboratory in 1964 but little did he know at that time just how controversial the setting would eventually become
 
sagan was a member of a group with the name of the order of the dolphin and this was a secretive group the name does not suggest it but in fact the group was focused on looking for extraterrestrial intelligence
 
another man in the group was dr john lilly and he had written a book with the title of man and dolphin which had the theory that dolphins wanted to communicate with human beings his writing set an experiment off that did not quite go as planned
 
nasa helped with funding for communication between humans and dolphins

frank drake an astronomer at the national radio astronomy observatory green bank telescope was behind the project ozma he was looking for alien life through radio waves that were being emitted from other planets when he read the book wrote by lilly he reached some parallels between his own work and that of lillys he helped to get funding from nasa along with other government agencies to realize his vision a bridge of communication between dolphins and human beings
 
he built a laboratory with workspace on the upper level along with an enclosure for dolphins on the bottom in the caribbean and called it dolphin point margaret howe lovatt aged 23 visited the lab and she was hoping to witness a breakthrough and see the stories she had heard about dolphins being able to communicate with humans
 
she met with gregory bateson at the lab and was allowed to watch the dolphins and take notes while she watched them even though she did not have any training she was intuitive and was offered an open invitation and began to work with the dolphins she helped them to create sounds that were humanesque but the whole process was tedious she convinced lilly to allow her to live in the lab and waterproofed the rooms in the upper part of the building and filled them with a few feet of water so that dolphins and humans could share the same space
 
male dolphin develops sexual urges for trainer
 
peter the dolphin was chosen for an immersive language experiment and lovatt found that he was interested in anatomy he would look at the backs of her knees for a long time and wondered how the legs worked however peter then started to have urges and would rub himself on her knee foot or hand and she had to force the dolphin back down into the water many times she said that eventually she decided to satisfy the dolphins sexual urges as it was easier to incorporate them and allow them to happen she insisted that there was nothing sexual on her part however they did bond even closer drake became disappointed when he found out that the experiment was not going quite as planned with the dolphin language and could have been the beginning of the end for the funding however while the project was waning the attachment between peter and lovatt grew
 
the livein experience with the dolphins came to an end and it was not long before peter the dolphin died by suicide it seems apparently dolphins require conscious effort to breathe and peter just took a breath and sank to the bottom of his pool and never came up it was said that he was heartbroken and could not understand why they had been separated

"__label__fake 10 important stories from 092517 box scores hanigers big night judge makes history more
before its news
by ray kuhn
we are now officially in the last week of the season and at this point you either want the season to end immediately or you are hoping it continues just long enough for you to get into first place either way we have you covered here as we take a look at some of the performances that stood out from a busy monday around the league
1 judge makes history
aaron judge made sure to avoid any drama as he both tied and broke the rookie record for home runs on monday judge is now at 50 home runs on the season as he has proved his power is slump proof following the allstar game judge weathered quite the dry spell but his returned in a big way its not like he lost his power but judge batted 185 in august with just three home runs we know that judge can handle adversity as he has followed his worst month up with his best so far this month judge is hitting 307 with 13 home runs and 26 rbi while you are going to have to live with some slumps as the strikeouts will never go away it was good to see judge bounce back strong
2 sims picks up the win
after previously being a top pitching prospect lucas sims hit some rough patches in the minor leagues and was then overtaken by some of the braves new acquisitions the righthander though is still just 23 years old and in 20 games 19 starts this season at triplea he had a respectable 375 era and 114 whip prior to his promotion on monday sims took advantage of a struggling mets team as he picked up his third victory of the season sims limited new york to two runs on five hits and two walks in 62 innings the start dropped sims era to 485 as he works to solidify his role for next season sims needs to work to keep the ball on the ground only 373 ground ball rate and he only is striking out 695 batters per nine innings the sample size is small but the results 471 fip are still not there i would keep an eye on sims but keep your expectations low
3 another young victorious pitcher
pitching for the nationals spots generally dont open up too frequently in the rotation that is why it is so important for aj cole to take advantage of his opportunity while cole is considered a prospect expectations and excitement arent through the roof in his eighth start of the season cole held the phillies to one run on six hits and two walks to pick up his third victory this is now the third season cole has spent time with washington making eight starts in each of the last two seasons and at 25 he seems to be settling into that swing role that doesnt hold much fantasy value that is what a 410 era and 157 whip will do to you
4 donaldson goes deep
yes josh donaldson did miss a chunk of time due to injury and the third baseman is batting just 266 this season even after a three hit effort last night but no im not sure we get to call the season a disappointment donaldson hit his 31st home run of the season on monday and he went on to drive in three runs which gave him 75 rbi i know those arent the numbers you had penciled in when you drafted donaldson but injuries do happen and he appears to be perfectly healthy to end the season donaldson is one of those players who could give you a little value on draft day especially the earlier you draft
5 gonzalez drives in three
who really thought that marwin gonzalez would lead the astros in rbi this season at the beginning of the season the assumption would be that a lot of things would have to go wrong for that to happen instead houston is just two games behind cleveland for the best record in all of baseball and gonzalez has 85 rbi the super utility man he played three positions last night drove in three runs on monday with one coming on his 23rd home run of the season gonzalez is now at 302 on the season and the 410 pitches per plate appearance he is seeing is a career high 369 last season who said you need a position to be an effective fantasy baseball contributor in gonzalezs case just have five positions
6 shields has a strong outing
yes i know it is still james shields at one point though shields was a sought after pitcher who wasnt just a punchline somewhere in the past few years shields lost his way and his fantasy value evolved into someone to target with your bats on monday the righthander picked up just his fifth victory of the season with seven innings of two run ball shields allowed just four hits and two walks while striking out eight but if you needed any reminder that this was still the shields you had become accustomed to the start lowered his era to 523 in five starts this month shields has a 394 era and while id consider him at arms length in certain situations he still has a way to go before im counting on him in 2018
7 bryant gets closer to 300
with three hits last night kris bryant is now sitting at 297 on the season with just a few games left to play while the third baseman is having a solid season it is not a performance worth of your first round pick bryants solo shot last night was his 29th home run of the season and just his 73rd rbi even in a down year it is nice to see bryant flirt with 300 and most likely finish with 30 home runs but we are left wanting more in fact this will give bryant a new career high batting average as he looks to bounce back in the power department next season while you can likely downgrade him by a few picks in next years draft i wouldnt make any rash decisions
8 hundley drives in four
when it comes to that second catcher spot there arent many places fantasy owners dont look stuck behind buster posey this season nick hundley managed to put together some solid production in the 274 at bats he was given hundley went deep last night his ninth home run of the season and drove in four runs that gave the catcher a 252 batting average with 34 rbi as he begins to look for a job for next season when he is in the lineup hundley does have some power and the batting average isnt a complete liability keep an eye on where hundley ends up for the 2018 season
9 haniger goes deep twice
with two separate injuries 2016 could have gone better for mitch haniger but when he has been in the lineup batting second the outfielder has lived up to the sleeper expectations placed on him at the beginning of the season haniger went deep twice last night a solo shot and a two run homer to give him 16 home runs on the season in 346 at bats he is hitting a solid 277 with 46 rbi and the mariners have to like what they are seeing out of their right fielder for next season dont let the numbers fool you as he likely would have come closer to 25 home runs had he played a full season
10 forsythe drives in four
the dodgers can afford to cast a wide net when it comes to veteran additions and so far it hasnt quite worked out with logan forsythe he has struggled in los angeles and never really got going last night he filled in at third base and went three for three with a walk while missing the cycle by a triple it was just the sixth home run of the season for forsythe who despite his four rbi is at just 36 on the season in 348 at bats perhaps he is a veteran bounce back candidate next season if he lands a starting role but for now he is more of a utility man

"__label__fake start em or sit em 2017 week 5 carson wentz marshawn lynch latavius murray more
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
trying to decide who you should start or sit this week lets take a look at a few potential decisions owners have and try to sort through them
quarterbacks
start carson wentz philadelphia eagles vs arizona
after putting up 250 yards or less in each of the past two weeks while throwing for 1 td per week it would be easy to ignore wentz the cardinals are in the bottom half of the league in points allowed per week to opposing quarterbacks and thats despite facing the colts and 49ers thats not to say that they arent a talented group but at the same time philadelphia will have an opportunity to produce through the air wentz will also be playing at home where he played significantly better last season
home 648 completion rate 9 td 5 int
road 604 completion rate 7 td 9 int
this would be a good opportunity to utilize wentz especially with the bye weeks causing trouble in setting our lineups
sit ben roethlisberger pittsburgh steelers at jacksonville
the jaguars are giving up the fewest points per week against opposing quarterbacks and thats because they have been so porous against the run third most points per week to opposing rb that should mean another leveon bellcentric attack he took 35 carries for 144 yards and 2 td in week 4 and limited chances for roethlisberger to make big plays hes coming off a week where he threw for 216 yards and has a season high of 263 back in week 1 throw in that he brings no value with his legs 7 carries for 5 yards and unless you have no other alternatives the risk far outweighs the reward
running backs
start marshawn lynch oakland raiders vs baltimore
lynch has been a bit of a disappointment in his return to the nfl averaging 34 yards per carry over his first four games and really limping as of late 15 carries for 30 yards over the past two weeks of course one of those games came against the dominant denver defense and washington has been very good as well things are different for week 5 where everything seems to be working in his favor
the loss of derek carr should lead to more rushing attempts
baltimore is traveling across the country
baltimore has allowed the fifth most points per week to opposing rb including the sixth most rushing yards 455 and 3 td
start latavius murray minnesota vikings at chicago
the loss of dalvin cook should mean an opportunity for murray who draws a favorable matchup in his first start while hes still working his way back from his ankle injury and may not be at full strength he should see the bulk of the early downshort yardage work against a bears defense thats allowed 4 rushing td tied for second most in the league theres a good chance that he hits the ground running hes not going to be a rb1 but hes a viable rb2must use flex option
sit andre ellington arizona cardinals at philadelphia
while its becoming obvious that ellington is the best option in the arizona backfield that doesnt necessarily mean that hes going to get the bulk of the touches he seems destined to share things with chris johnson and while he saw 14 targets in week 4 its hard to imagine that being replicated as the wide receiving corps gets healthy throw in that the eagles have done a good job at stopping opposing running backs including just 16 receptions and ellington is a flex option at best and a riskier one at that
sit donta foreman houston texans vs kansas city
foreman has started eating into the touches of lamar miller including 13 carries in week 4 though he hasnt been particularly productive he has 34 carries for 114 yards 34 yardscarry and managed just 2 receptions and they came in the same game the chiefs also arent an ideal matchup and with the potential for deshaun watson to be given more opportunities hes an obvious sit
wide receivers tworeceiver formats
start devante parker miami dolphins vs tennessee
while parker has scored 1 td in his first three games hes been targeted at least 8 times each week and has turned them into 69 yards 18 receptions for 230 yards tennessee has allowed 8 td to opposing wide receivers most in the league no one else has allowed more than 6 and parker offers the most potential to find the end zone from miamis receiving corps you could argue him as a borderline wr1
sit sammy watkins los angeles rams vs seattle
the seahawks may not be the same defense that they once were but theyve still done a good job of shutting down opposing wide receivers that alone would scare us off from watkins and despite the rams offense coming together watkins has been targeted twice in two of the four games 16 total targets and only has one big day 106 yards and 2 td in week 3 against the 49ers theres far too much risk involved
wide receivers threereceiver formats
start devin funchess carolina panthers at detroit
kelvin benjamin is banged up and while he did play in week 4 you still have to wonder if he will be limited funchess has often had issues with efficiency but hes coming off a day where he turned 9 targets into 7 receptions 70 yards and 2 td we cant expect the td but the opportunities should still be there against a defense that has allowed the eighth most receptions to opposing wide receivers through four weeks 51 receptions for 605 yards
sit marqise leeallen hurns jacksonville jaguars at pittsburgh
the jaguars offense is based around leonard fournette with the teams top two receivers combining for 29 receptions 345 yards and 2 td couple those uninspiring numbers with a road matchup against a defense thats allowed the fourth fewest receptions to opposing wide receivers 35 for 339 yards and 2 td and this duo should be avoided
tight ends
start hunter henry los angeles chargers at new york giants
hes the epitome of a boom or bust player thus far and also will have to contend with antonio gates who could syphon off some of the tight end opportunities that said the giants have been the worst defense against opposing tight ends including 5 td allowed its only going to take one big play for henry to register a usable performance and theres a good chance he provides more than just one
sit jack doyle indianapolis colts vs san francisco
the 49ers have allowed 10 receptions and 77 yards to opposing tight ends this season combine that with some underwhelming performances from doyle who has a total of 43 yards over the past two weeks and 17 receptions 163 yards and 0 td overall and this is an easy situation to avoid even with the bye weeks there are better opportunities to try and exploit

"__label__real brazils staterun oil company petrobras lpg fuelling stations are seen in the guanabara bay in rio de janeiro brazil october 7 2017 reuterspilar olivares
london reuters opec forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018 on wednesday and said its productioncutting deal with rival producers was getting rid of a glut pointing to a tighter market that could move into a deficit next year
in a monthly report the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said the market could find support in winter from low distillate fuel stocks and forecasts of colder weather which would boost distillates demand for heating
opec said the world would need 3306 million barrels per day bpd of its crude next year up 230000 bpd from its previous forecast that is its third consecutive monthly increase in the projection from its first estimate made in july
the report illustrates growing confidence among opec officials that its supply cut is working still opec is not banking on a surge in prices saying in the report crude is expected to remain at 50 to 55 a barrel in the next year brent oil lcoc1 traded higher near 57 on wednesday
with the market moving into the winter season distillate fuel supplies are notably tight representing a change from the excess supplies seen in the last two years opec said
opec and key nonopec oil producers continue to successfully drain the oil market of excess barrels
in a deal aimed at clearing the glut opec is curbing output by about 12 million bpd while russia and other nonopec producers are cutting half as much until march 2018
the 14country producer group said its oil output in september as assessed by secondary sources came in below the 2018 demand forecast even though production climbed by about 89000 bpd to 3275 million bpd
in a further sign that the supply excess is easing opec said inventories in developed economies declined by 247 million barrels in august to 2996 billion barrels 171 million barrels above the fiveyear average
opec and its allies want to bring stocks down to the fiveyear average and are discussing extending their supply restraint
headwinds for shale
opec lowered its estimate of supply growth from nonopec countries next year seeing a rise of 940000 bpd down 60000 bpd from the previous forecast due to downward revisions to russia
the report also cited headwinds in 2018 for an expansion of supplies in us shale such as lower drilling efficiency and cost inflation growth in us shale three years ago contributed to the global excess opecs cut is now targeting
the supply forecast for next year will be revised downward if higher oil prices and lower costs do not materialize the report said
oil prices are expected to remain at 5055 in the next year a rise above that level would encourage us oil producers to expand their drilling activities otherwise the lower prices could lead to a reduction in their capex
the price expectation given on page 45 of the 96page report is an assumption not a forecast opec sources said opec does not issue price forecasts
opec raised its forecasts for global oil demand growth in 2017 and 2018 saying consumption would rise by 138 million bpd next year 30000 bpd more than previously thought
the reports opec production figures mean compliance with the supply cut by the 11 members with output targets remains high at 98 percent according to a reuters calculation
this is up from 83 percent initially reported in august as septembers rise in overall opec output was led by nigeria and libya which are exempt from the cut
should opec keep pumping at septembers level the market could move into a deficit next year the report indicates
top producer saudi arabia told opec it pumped 9973 million bpd in september up about 22000 bpd from august and still below its opec target of 10058 million bpd"

tmz sports reported thursday that the recently paroled oj simpson was seen signing memorabilia in a secret autograph session tuesday night
tmz sports tweeted a photo of simpsons signing as well
the signing reportedly took place in a private room at a las vegas hotel and simpson was planning to do the same wednesday night
simpson was granted parole in july after serving nine years in prison for armed robbery and kidnapping and he was released sunday
while simpson was found not guilty of the 1994 murders of nicole brown simpson and ron goldman he lost a civil suit that ordered he pay their families 33500000
simpson now owes 100 million due to 22 years of interest and while tmz sports reported that he has no intention of paying taking underthetable payments for autographs could be a violation of his parole
the nineyear prison term simpson recently completed was the direct result of sports memorabilia as he and his armed associates attempted to seize items simpson said belonged to him in a las vegas hotel room in 2007
the 70yearold simpson is a member of the pro football hall of fame and was a standout both collegiately at usc and in the nfl as a member of the buffalo bills"

"__label__fake thursday night start em or sit em week 4 randall cobb jordan howard tarik cohen more
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
thursday games are often tricky as it is because there isnt necessarily a reason to take any undue risks with questionable options which could set you back and spoil your week who are the borderline players that should be in lineups who should be sat down lets take a look at the skill players taking the field tonight and try to answer those questions
chicago bears
jordan howard running back
its intriguing that hes not listed on the injury reported despite having been battling a sprained ac joint in his shoulder that said on the surface it didnt appear to hinder him in week 3 turning a season high 23 carries into 138 yards and 2 td while also adding 5 receptions for 26 yards he did lose a fumble and you have to wonder if the bears will be forced into passing mode early due to falling behind a team that is flat out better
the packers have allowed the eighth most points per week to opposing running backs being beaten by both the run and the pass
rushing 291 yards and 2 td
receiving 86 yards and 2 td
there is the potential that game flow leads to howard being shelved later in the game but he remains a lowend rb2flex option due to the upside
verdict rb2flex in all formats
tarik cohen running back
cohen totaled 102 yards 78 rushing 24 receiving in week 3 despite howard setting a season high in carries hes going to remain the passing down back already racking up 20 receptions for 126 yards and 1 td on 25 targets leading all running backs through three weeks he also could get a lot more run later in the game if the bears are playing from behind and trying to catch up to green bay regardless the matchup is favorable and the bears deficiencies in the receiving corps is going to mean opportunities for both running backs to produce consider cohen a viable rb2 in all ppr formats must start and a potential flex option in all formats
verdict must start in ppr formats flex option in all formats
mike glennon quarterback
theres already been rumblings about moving to mitch trubitsky and while the team won week 3 it wasnt because of glennon 101 yards 1 td 1 int even in twoquarterback formats there is far too much risk
verdict sit em
kendall wright wide receiver
the bears have been hit hard by injuries to the receiving corps leaving wright as the leader of an underwhelming group of course hes managed just 10 receptions on 14 targets for 103 yards and 0 td the offense is going to run through the running back duo leaving the scraps to everyone else and in an uninspiring offense theres no value elsewhere
verdict sit em
zach miller tight end
he hasnt had more than 42 receiving yards in a game despite a receiving corps that lacks much upside at this point there is the potential for him to go off in any week but with the packers allowing the fewest points per week to opposing tight ends this isnt the time to expect it
verdict sit em
must start options
none
green bay packers
davante adams wide receiver
randall cobb appears to be heading towards a return but you have to think that hes going to be limited in what he can do thats going to leave adams who leads the packers receiving corps with 206 yards as a solid option in all formats the matchup should be favorable so unless you are extremely deep hes well worth using as a wr23 in all formats
verdict worth utilizing as a wr23
randall cobb wide receiver
theres no questioning his upside when healthy with 21 targets over the first two weeks the question is after sitting out week 3 just how much is cobb going to be able to do this week youd have to think that hes going to be limited in his opportunities and given the other options you would expect cobb to be on some sort of a pitch count that puts a lot of risk in play here especially early in the week
verdict sit since the risk outweighs the reward
geronimo allison wide receiver
allison had a big game in week 3 with 6 receptions and 122 yards however with cobb looking likely to return allison should fall back into the fourth option in a deep receiving corps throw in the presence of ty montgomery and martellus bennett and theres no way to trust him
verdict sit em
martellus bennett tight end
hes the type of player that you want to believe in yet hes turned 21 targets into 11 receptions and has not yet found the end zone one of these weeks hes likely to explode but given the other options that are out there and the potential for another poor performance theres no reason to take the risk on thursday night
verdict sit em
must start options
aaron rodgers quarterback
ty montgomery running back
jordy nelson wide receiver

"__label__fake by derrick broze
the department of homeland security has made public a rule which calls for collecting social media info on immigrants
a new report is shining light on a practice by the department of homeland security which asks officers to include social media data and search results within the departments files on immigrants in america buzzfeed news reports that the dhs published a new rule in the federal register last week which specifically calls for including social media handles and aliases associated identifiable information and search results
we see this as part of a larger process of hightech surveillance of immigrants and more and more people being subjected to social media screening adam schwartz an attorney with the electronic frontier foundation told buzzfeed news theres a growing trend at the department of homeland security to be snooping on the social media of immigrants and foreigners and we think its an invasion of privacy and deters freedom of speech
the new rule which is set to go into effect october 18 could also affect us citizens who use social media to communicate with immigrants buzzfeed also reported that the dhs claims the rule is not a new policy but rather the posting was an attempt at transparency and due to updates in the electronic immigration system
dhs published this notice in the federal register on sept 18 to comply with the administrative requirements of the privacy act to help address these requirements not launch a new policy initiative the agency said dhs in its lawenforcement and immigrationprocess capacity has and continues to monitor publiclyavailable social media to protect the homeland
the buzzfeed report came on the heels of an acknowledgement from the national security agency regarding mass surveillance of foreign nationals according to cnn several senior us officials confirmed surveillance of more than 100000 foreign nationals outside the us the us governments mass surveillance programs pay no mind to arbitrary borders on a map the nsa dia and cia spy on whoever they want with impunity
the dhs policy whether new or standard practice is going to put at risk the remaining bits of privacy americans are desperately clinging to overall the practice of surveillance of immigrants and militarization of the border is simply par for the course for the trump administration the public is told if they want to secure the border they must give up freedoms and accept tyranny at the border activist post recently reported that the trump administration is using stingray cell phone surveillance tools to monitor undocumented migrants when combined with recent plans to scan the face of every person coming in and out of the united states and the growing biometric wall a picture of complete and total surveillance comes into view the surveillance and police state of america are eerily reminiscent to the post911 plan for total information awareness
still despite the growing surveillance and the complacency of the average person there is some pushback to the surveillance state activist post recently reported the dhs is facing a federal class action lawsuit for violating the rights of people crossing the us border by searching and confiscating their laptops and cell phones
legal challenges are a frontline of defense against the creep of tyranny but we must not stop there we need mass opting out civil disobedience and noncompliance to these programs we need people filming illegal checkpoints live streaming police interactions asserting their rights and opting out of taxation whenever possible so these programs lose the moral and financial support necessary to continue their totalitarian scheme

"__label__fake rugby world cup 2023 a buggers muddle
before its news
this week has seen london play host to the bids of france south africa and ireland to stage the 2023 rugby world cup with the respective bidding teams displaying their respective wares in front of world rugby
with frances president emmanuel macron deciding that he couldnt be arsed to attend the presentation or endorse the french bid frances bidding team turned to an ingenious although somewhat bizarre plan b by choosing to parade the young sons of new zealand rugby legend jonah lomu as part of the bid jonah quite liked france apparently which is nice
south africas strategy meanwhile appeared to be based on the fact that they once hosted the rugby world cup well over 20 years ago when that very nice smiley man nelson mandela was president no mention surprisingly that for financial reasons south africa had recently decided against bidding to host the 2022 commonwealth games
and as for the irish apparently if ireland wins the bid to host the world cup in 2023 it will somehow and i kid you not make rugby incredibly popular in the united states of america call me naive but wouldnt hosting the event in the usa be more likely to do that
go figure and while youre doing that please bear in mind that the irish bid has also won the backing of uk prime minister theresa may what could possibly go wrong

"__label__real what did you most connect with in the marston story
there was this incredible love story at the origin of what wonder woman would come to be the marstons were psychologists and they really thought that if you could change hearts and minds you could change the world marston called wonder woman psychological propaganda to try to get young boys and men to respect powerful women and find their power attractive and he had this notion that if women ran the world the world would be a better place
video
the wonder woman aspect of the story seems an easy sell but the kink and the threeway relationship less so did you think you would have trouble getting this made
i spent many a night arguing with myself being like why are you even bothering to work on this because it will never see the light of day but i became obsessed with telling it whether or not it would come to fruition because i became enchanted with the characters and the process of writing it i really wanted to tell a very organic love story without any editorializing or winking i didnt want to otherize the experience of what they were doing i made the decision very overtly to tell the story using the conventions of a classic prestige biopic i thought the content in and of itself was so potentially controversial that i wanted to just treat their lives the way you would treat anybody elses life i feel that kink is often portrayed in the movies as scandalous and dark or transgressive but in their case i didnt think it was in the film its linked to this notion of fantasy versus reality in this fantastical world which ultimately leads to wonder woman they can be their truest version of themselves
frequently female filmmakers will make one independent film and not make another for years if at all while men may make an indie and then be given a franchise as a black lesbian director you made the short film debs got studio money to make a feature of it then got to helm a movie in disneys herbie franchise the next year how did you defy the odds
nina jacobson was running disney and she was an amazing mentor to me and i dont know if i would have gotten that job if nina wasnt running the studio at that point but she loved debs and was a really big supporter of mine and gave me the job
photo
professor marston and the wonder women is your first feature since herbie in 2005 although you frequently work in television did you find it hard to get another movie off the ground in that time
it was less like i feel like i cant get my movie made it was more the stories i wanted to tell after herbie i tried to set up a bunch of projects and they always had strong female protagonists i would sell them to studios but i realized they were never going to make them i think the actual executives wanted to but the machinery of the industry was like these kinds of movies with female leads flop
but i had worked as a writer of the first season of the l word and the series creator ilene chaiken said why dont you come and direct a few episodes it was just fantastic because there were all these strong female roles in cable it was just when the wind really started hitting the sails of this kind of cable television revolution and i feel like i was if not on the ground floor on the second floor of that
advertisement continue reading the main story
how did you decide you wanted to make movies
i originally wanted to be a theater director but i remember a long time ago i was marching in the gay pride parade in manhattan and around the same time the friends episode with the lesbian moms had aired i remember thinking how many people am i reaching walking down fifth avenue thirty million people saw a positive portrayal of lesbian moms through their friend ross and how much does that move the dial so i became very interested in how pop culture can really move forward political progress"
"__label__fake the 2017 white sox season provided more positives than negatives
before its news
late sunday afternoon tim anderson grounded out to third base to end the 2017 chicago white sox season a season in which the teams future was decided before pitchers and catchers reported back in february the 2017 season was the beginning of a rebuild for the white sox and all those involved were dreading having to go through the death march that is a rebuilding noncompetitive season in the end it didnt feel that bad especially with the arrow pointing up for the white sox heading into 2018 with two major trades that sent quality talent elsewhere before the start of the season on april 3rd opening day could not have gotten off to a rockier start for the white sox and their fan base the original opening day was confusing as a good portion of the fans showed up and were only treated to player introductions before the game postponed due to rain the season would start the following day and saw jose quintana get roughed up in his first opening day start giving up five runs quintanas early season struggles worried fans as they feared his inconsistencies would hurt his trade value they were wrong as quintana would garner the biggest regular season acquisition for the white sox as he was traded to the crosstown chicago cubs on july 13th as the cubs sent back highly touted prospects in outfielder eloy jiminez and pitcher dylan cease during the first half of the white sox season fans were more interested the possibilities of trades for such white sox players as todd frazier melky cabrera david robertson tommy kahle and miguel gonzalez all of who were traded during the season general manager rick hahn did his best to get the highest value for each player with the league knowing that the white sox were looking to trade off assets already his most impressive trades actually received the lowest amount of attention as he traded relief pitcher anthony swarzak to the milwaukee brewers on july 25th in return for the brewers 13th ranked prospect outfielder ryan cordell two days later hahn traded another relief pitcher in dan jennings to the tampa bay rays in return for first baseman casey gillaspie who was named the rays 2016 minor league player of the year the second half of the season was exciting for a different reason as a good portion of the minor league talent the white sox had acquired in the offseason trades were called up to the majors to play the rest of the season the most exciting callup was for second baseman yoan moncada who was the main piece for the white sox in the chris sale trade in 53 games moncada drew 28 walks and finished with a slash line of 230335743 other prospects called up were pitchers lucas giolito reynaldo lopez and carson fulmer who all pitched well in the month of september recording quality starts in most of their outings it is also important to note the achievements of two of the remaining veterans for the white sox in first baseman jose abreu and outfielder avasil garcia abreu made history as he posted his fourth consecutive season with 25 home runs and over 100 rbis driven to start a career joining only albert pujols and joe dimaggio as the only players in major league history to do so garcia had a season no one saw coming as he finished third in the majors for batting average as he hit 330 on the season and made the allstar team for the first time he improved his batting average by 85 points and his on base percentage by 73 the white sox added to the rebuild during the season as they signed the mostsought after international talent in outfielder luis robert on may 27th robert is ranked third on the white sox top 30 prospects list and ranks 22nd on mlbs top 100 prospects list he is one of six white sox players on the top 100 list four of which rank in the top 50 of that list in 2016 the white sox had only two players rank on that list with none being in the top 50 of the list unlike the 201617 offseason the white sox will not have a lot of major league talent to trade for minor league prospects as the only veteran talent they will feature will be garcia and abreu hahn will look to sign midlevel free agents again with the hopes to flip them for prospects at the trade deadline just like did this season the team has the possibility to compete in 2018 or at least show signs of improvement from this season as their young talent will have another year of major league experience underneath their belt also prospects such as jiminez michael kopech alec hansen and zach collins have the possibility of making their major league debut in 2018 in a season that saw the white sox lose 95 games and obtain the fourth overall pick in next years amateur draft the season as a whole was more exciting than what it was initially expected to be the players on this seasons roster deserve a lot of recognition as they played hard and had fun as a team even with knowing what was expected all season long fans and the organization handled the first year of a rebuild as there were more positive vibes than negative vibes during the entirety of the season when the white sox are competitive once again the 2017 season will serve as a fond memory for all as it will be looked at as where it all began for the white sox future success

"__label__real david ortiz was the one constant for those three teams and his retirement at the end of last season took away some of the red soxs distinctiveness they had a successful regular season winning 93 games and the american league east title but little stood out about this edition of the squad
price himself was often more of a distraction in 2017 than anything else being hampered by elbow problems and creating a disturbing confrontation with the red sox announcer dennis eckersley over his commentary on the team the pressures of trying to live up to the sevenyear 217 million contract that price signed with boston before last season appeared to be getting to him
in september the red sox with price again available to pitch decided to use him out of the bullpen rather than as part of the rotation

he pitched effectively for two and twothirds innings in game 2 of this series although it ended up a blowout loss for boston as did game 1 and sundays game 3 seemed about to follow the same path before the journeyman starter doug fister could get a second out for the red sox in the top of the first houston was already ahead 30 with two of the runs scoring on a homer by carlos correa
but the red sox lineup led by hanley ramirez who vowed to cut off his dreadlocks if boston rallied to win the series quickly answered the rookie third baseman rafael devers blasted a long drive over the bullpen in rightcenter field for a tworun homer in the third inning putting the red sox up by 43 their first postseason lead since game 1 of last years division series
at that point the red sox handed the ball to price and asked him to keep houston in check
he did hurling four shutout innings and allowing only four hits he also struck out four astros with red sox fans reacting each time as if price were the second coming of pedro martinez
price did not get the victory which means his career postseason wonloss record remains an unsightly 28 but by the time he was done for the day boston had an insurmountable 103 lead and a renewed sense of determination
price refused to rule out pitching in game 4 despite his 57 pitches on sunday farrell was clearly hoping that some of prices performance might rub off on rick porcello who will be the game 4 starter for boston and who followed up his cy young season of 2016 with a deflating 1117 record this year
go out and do his job farrell said of porcello go out and locate
they were feisty words from the manager at the end of an emotional afternoon as the red sox motivated by resentment and pride were able to make this into a real series after all"

while it is a rare occasion when the group claiming to represent the will of the american people actually votes accordingly the house of representatives voted in opposition of attorney general jeff sessions plan to expand civil asset forfeiture on tuesday
the make america secure and prosperous appropriations act will now include amendment 126 which restricts the use of the federal governments use of adoptive forfeiture it is cosponsored by a group of nine bipartisan representatives including justin amash a republican from michigan and tulsi gabbard a democrat from hawaii

ill be on house floor soon with justin amash urging support for our bipartisan amendment to stop ag sessions expansion of adoptive forfeiture gabbard wrote on twitter adoptive forfeiture allows state law enforcement to sidestep state laws and use federal law to seize peoples property without conviction or charges burden of proving innocence is on the individual not on law enforcement even if innocence proved the propertycash is often not returned

burden of proving innocence is on the individual not on law enforcement even if innocence proved the propertycash is often not returned tulsi gabbard tulsigabbard september 12 2017
defining civil asset forfeiture as a pernicious practice that throws due process out of the window and allows permanent seizure of assets based on an extraordinarily low evidentiary standard freedomworksorg noted that amendment 126 seeks to prohibit the use of funds authorized by division c from being used for adoptive seizures through which state and local agencies can circumvent protective state laws to seek forfeiture of seized assets under federal forfeiture laws
sessions announced a new policy to increase civil asset forfeiture in july labeling it as a means to better protect victims of crime and innocent property owners while streamlining the process to more easily dismantle criminal and terrorist organizations
the firearms survival guide ad as any of these law enforcement partners will tell you and as president trump knows well civil asset forfeiture is a key tool that helps law enforcement defund organized crime take back illgotten gains and prevent new crimes from being committed and it weakens the criminals and the cartels even more importantly it helps return property to the victims of crime civil asset forfeiture takes the material support of the criminals and instead makes it the material support of law enforcement funding priorities like new vehicles bulletproof vests opioid overdose reversal kits and better training in departments across this country funds that were once used to take lives are now being used to save lives
however as the free thought project has reported extensively and as the majority of the representatives in the house seem to understand civil asset forfeiture has only led to more corruption
in fact even one of the cocreators of the civil asset forfeiture program in the united states has said he thinks it should be abolished three decades ago i helped create our civil asset forfeiture system now it is time to end it brad cates former director of the us justice departments asset forfeiture office said in february 2016
during the reagan administration i helped establish these programs because i believed they would quickly channel seized criminals profits into the fight against organized crime and drug cartels yet over time we have created a new bad incentive policing for profit out of the reach of the proper legislative budget process
the purpose of due process is to ensure that suspects are given a chance to prove their innocence however when police are given the power to confiscate cash weapons cars and other possessions the suspects they are targeting are assumed guilty until proven innocent and even if their innocence is proven in court their possessions that were stolen by the state are not always returned

while most western countries are reverting back to medieval technology to combat the use of drones legendary russian arms manufacturer kalashnikov makers of the ak series has developed an advanced antidrone gun drones are now becoming more widely available therefore antidrone technology is becoming a major field in the defense industry
of course kalashnikov is leading the pack in antidrone warfare built on the mp514k rifle system the fully modular device comes equipped with interchangeable jamming units which disrupt gps glonass wifi and other electronic and radio signals rendering drones inoperable due to its ability to block phone signals the device also can be used to prevent remote detonation of improvised explosives
meet the rex1
for the first time in russia kalashnikov concern the largest arms manufacturer in the country showed off its electromagnetic antidrone rifles at the army2017 expo in the moscow region prototypes of the rex1 are also undergoing tests in some subunits of the russian national guard
the gun has some fascinating features which makes it extremely effective it is able to fire continuously for four hours it can then be recharged for four hours using an ordinary 220volt socket or it can be connected to an additional battery for uninterrupted use and according to nikita khamitov head of the special projects department at zala aero group the company that developed the new weapon and is part of kalashnikov concern its possible to change each component in a matter of seconds just like changing the magazine on an assault rifle
this radiomagnetic gun suppresses the command and control channels of the worlds most commonly encountered drones its also installed with a number of interchangeable electromagnetic and infrared units that suppress gsm gps glonass galileo the last three are various types of satellite navigation systems rbth and other channels said khamitov rbth
drones generally have two default modes in case communication is lost with the operator they will either return to the start point or automatically land in the latter case the drone will disappear from enemy radars and you effectively have a new toy in your hands khamitov added a particular feature of the device is the possibility of not just neutralizing unmanned aerial vehicles but also explosive devices triggered by remote control via a phone call or text message as one sees in films the gun shuts out all external signals and gives the combat engineer group time to arrive on the spot and completely eliminate the threat khamitov said
and its possible you could end up getting your hands on a rex1 too well the civilian version anyway according to khamitov a version of the gun could definitely be designed for the civilian market or course not all its functions would be made available for instance in the civilian version the gps neutralizing device would not be included
the price of the weapon will be determined when the subunits of the federal national guard troops service decide the number they want to procure looking at the market i think the civilian version of our system could cost around 5000 khamitov said

all things biometric are sweeping across the world at warp speed now from security on planes and trains to checkins at conferences and events banking systems etc but the use of facial recognition tech in policing is being touted as the next big thing to keep the public safe in fact facial recognition technology is already working on the next level of development with researchers constructing new algorithms that supposedly can penetrate the most simple method of avoidance wearing a mask
however a recent event in britain should cause those who are high on this technology to rein in their enthusiasm according to a sky news report a recent carnival in notting hill was treated as a testing ground for police facial recognition systems the results were troubling
the controversial trial of facial recognition equipment at notting hill carnival resulted in roughly 35 false matches and an erroneous arrest the system only produced a single accurate match during the course of carnival but the individual had already been processed by the justice system between the time police compiled the suspect database and deployed it
firstly the fact that the general public were used as guinea pigs by the police state when they were there to enjoy a celebratory event shows the level of disdain for basic civil liberties secondly the fact that a test should result in actual questioning and detentions only doubles down on the violations to personal freedom lastly one might wonder how any matches were made to begin with sky news reveals what we in the us also have come to learn the government has built a secret database including innocent people thats just been waiting for the implementation of the recognition systems
in the days before carnival sky news revealed that police have more than 20 million facial recognition images on the british public including hundreds of thousands on innocent people there are a number of legal questions surrounding the polices databases especially following a high court ruling in 2012 which said that the retention of those images was unlawful
that ruling seems to matter little to the metropolitan police who clearly suggest that such trials will continue
the met said we have always maintained that it was a continued trial to test the technology and assess if it could assist police in identifying known offenders in large events in order to protect the wider public a full analysis of its deployments and a wider consultation will take place at the conclusion of the trial the spokesperson added although no date was given for this sky sources have suggested that the met is planning to trial the technology at other events in the future
this is the type of lawlessness that has now taken over law enforcement in an age where the public is just expected to endure a full loss of liberty in the name of security

as many americans struggle to get back on their feet after their homes were destroyed by hurricanes harvey and irma the united states government has insisted that the only way to raise money for relief efforts is to increase the national debtwhile setting aside another 75 million in aid for israel
just one year ago the obama administration signed the largest military aid deal in us history promising israel 38 billion over the next 10 years however while the deal stated that israel was expected to return any money that was more than the original amount the trump administration is breaking the rules
according to a report from the jerusalem post while secretary of state rex tillerson was against giving an additional 75 million to israel a senior state department official insisted that the administration is committed to ensuring that israel receives the assistance that has been appropriated by congress and that trump will work to ensure the 75 million in additional aid is delivered
while congress had no problem giving israel another 75 million in military aid it did so by once again turning a blind eye to the long list of human rights abuses carried out by the israeli militaryand funded by the united states israel has occupied palestine since 1967 and in those 50 years it has been accused of numerous categories of human rights violations according to a report from human rights watch
at least five categories of major violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law characterize the occupation unlawful killings forced displacement abusive detention the closure of the gaza strip and other unjustified restrictions on movement and the development of settlements along with the accompanying discriminatory policies that disadvantage palestinians
when donald trump ran a campaign based on making america great again and truly putting america first his supporters latched on to his promises as if his presence in the white house would make everything different while some of trumps supporters were adamant about his support for israel it should be noted that the trump administration is not just putting israel firstit is also putting every country that is a recipient of us foreign aid at a time when americans desperately need help first

as congress debated raising the debt ceiling in order to find money for hurricane relief efforts sen rand paul proposed an amendment that would allocate 785 billion in aid for repairing the damage caused by hurricane harvey with an additional 25 billion set aside to prepare for hurricane irmaall by simply making cuts to foreign aid
my amendment the america first amendment would take the money from money that we were going to send to foreign countries paul said we send billions and billions of dollars to countries who hate us we send billions and billions of dollars to countries who burn our flag i think its a very simple choice that when were looking at those in need in our country we quit sending money to other countries

in response to pauls proposal senate majority leader mitch mcconnell made a motion to table it which passed 8710 unfortunately while the majority of congress does not seem to care about how much money the us is wasting on foreign aid it also does not seem to care about the status of the national debt
the united states national debt surpassed 20 trillion this week after jumping 317645000000 in one day the trump administrations 75 million gift to israel is in addition to the recordbreaking 38 billion a year the country already receives from the us
the idea that the united states should continue to hand out obscene amounts of money it doesnt have to the nations it favorswith no oversightis a reminder that the vast majority of the elected officials who claim to represent the will of the american public do not have their best interest in mind

"__label__real washington cnn many democratic office holders were quick to repudiate disgraced hollywood executive harvey weinstein following a bombshell report detailing decades of alleged sexual harassment
but former democratic presidents barack obama and bill clinton as well as former secretary of state hillary clinton all of whom have longstanding ties to weinstein a major democratic party fundraiser have not publicly addressed the accusations
representatives for the clintons have not responded to comment for this story and obamas office declined to comment clinton did not mention weinstein during an appearance monday night at the university of california davis as part of her book tour her first public appearance since the story broke
the recent report in the new york times cataloged accusations of sexual harassment against the filmmaker that spanned three decades three days after the report weinstein was fired by the company he cofounded
longtime hillary clinton aides have been confused by the former secretary of states silence on the issue questioning in private why she has not weighed in at all
weinstein has long been a clinton donor with ties to the political family weinstein was one of many from hollywood who donated to bill clintons legal defense fund in the 1990s a washington post report from the time stated more recently the clintons rented a home next to weinstein in the hamptons in 2015 and weinstein served as a connector between hollywood stars and hillary clintons 2016 campaign
weinstein raised about 15 million from 19902016 according to data from the campaign financetracking center for responsive politics and was a bundler for clintons 2016 effort including at a starstudded fundraiser for clinton in june 2016 at weinsteins manhattan home
clinton personally headlined multiple fundraisers weinstein was involved in organizing during the campaign
crps opensecrets website shows weinstein was a bundler for obama as well and the hollywood giant visited the white house on several occasions during obamas tenure at a white house event for student films in 2013 first lady michelle obama credited weinstein for making the event happen and praised him as a wonderful person and a good friend
former vice president joe biden who has been outspoken on the issue of sexual assault also has not appeared to make any public statements about weinstein since the report came out bill russo a spokesman for the former vice president declined to comment
several democrats announced their intention to return donations received from weinstein or donate them to charity in the wake of the times report but as a bundler much of his work for campaigns was gathering up donations from others into large sums making potentially returning weinsteins donations more complicated for politicians like clinton and obama
calls for response
an editorial from the new york times on friday implored the clintons and obama to disavow weinstein calling on democrats to make sure his status as a major party donor would not prevent anyone from speaking out
some republicans have seized on the weinstein report and his ties to the democratic party
republican national committee chairwoman ronna romney mcdaniel said in an interview with cnns wolf blitzer on monday that clintons silence is deafening
just watched rnc chair weinstein and trump dont compare replay more videos must watch rnc chair weinstein and trump dont compare 0220
i applaud the democrats who are giving back that money mcdaniel said all of us should be speaking out against a sexual predator like harvey weinstein
mcdaniel pushed back however on any comparison of weinstein and president donald trump whom multiple women have accused of harassment and was infamously recorded by access hollywood saying he could grab women by their genitals
its not even comparable mcdaniel said citing the reported settlements weinstein had come to with women who had accused him saying trump didnt have eight settlements
after the access hollywood tape came out trump dismissed his comments as locker room talk
many democrats have also called on their colleagues to repudiate weinstein
connecticut sen chris murphy said in a cnn interview on sunday that democrats should give any money they received from weinstein back
i mean this is a pretty bad guy who did some really awful things murphy said
since her electoral defeat last november hillary clinton has been outspoken on a range of issues and during her presidential campaign she went after trump for allegations of sexual assault
bill clinton has been plagued by allegations of sexual harassment and assault throughout his own political career
in december 2015 hillary clinton was asked about some of the accusations and her own assertions that victims who allege assault should be believed in the context of allegations against her husband clinton said i would say that everyone should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence
obama has largely shied away from the public eye since leaving office apart from delivering a few speeches and issuing statements in response to trump administration moves on areas like climate change and the deferred action for childhood arrivals program"
"__label__real mr trump on tuesday also focused his fire again on jemele hill the sportscenter host on espn who previously called the president a white supremacist ms hill was suspended on monday for suggesting that fans boycott advertisers of the dallas cowboys after the team owner jerry jones threatened to bench players who knelt during the national anthem
with jemele hill at the mike it is no wonder espn ratings have tanked in fact tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry mr trump wrote on twitter
espn has faced significant challenges recently and is now available in just under 88 million homes compared with 100 million homes in 2011 in the first half of 2017 its primetime ratings were up 1 percent compared with the same period in 2016 although its total day ratings were down more than 5 percent but espn is still a ratings behemoth and still highly profitable in the third quarter it led fulltime cable networks in total day and primetime ratings among the key demographics of men ages 18 to 54
the president continues to be animated by his fight with the sports world he has enthusiastically kept up his attacks on the nfl with which he has a long history of antagonism a onetime owner of the new jersey generals in the upstart united states football league mr trump persuaded other owners to sue the nfl using antitrust law the usfl won the case but the jury awarded only 1 in damages tripled to 3 by law and mr trumps league ultimately folded
the nfls tax exemption has long been controversial the leagues 32 teams are forprofit businesses that pay taxes accordingly but the central office became a nonprofit organization decades ago in response to the criticism the league in 2015 voluntarily gave up its taxexempt status because of what it called the distraction
it is not clear that it cost the league much money while the league as a whole generates billions of dollars in revenue a year the league office ran a deficit of 135 million in the fiscal year that ended a year before the decision to give up the taxexempt status but the change meant the league no longer had to disclose what it paid its commissioner roger goodell

last month after the kneeling controversy erupted a republican congressman representative matt gaetz of florida introduced legislation stripping professional sports leagues of taxexempt status an idea that has been debated on capitol hill for years
in a conference call with reporters on tuesday joe lockhart the nfl spokesman said the league receives no massive tax breaks as mr trump contended
advertisement continue reading the main story
regarding the player protests mr lockhart said the leagues 260page game operations manual has not changed and he highlighted the precise language governing the anthem the players he said must be on the sidelines during the playing of the anthem and should stand for the anthem the league however has not chosen to discipline any of the players who have not stood for the anthem he said
that might change next week though when the owners meet in new york where the anthem protests will be on the agenda mr goodell and the owners want the players to stand because we think its an important part of the game mr lockhart said and theres a strong feeling at every level that we ought to be getting back to football
sports teams have benefited in other ways under tax law many franchises have built new stadiums in cooperation with cities and states that floated bonds to finance construction municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes leading critics to complain that taxpayers are subsidizing profitable private businesses mr lockhart said local government subsidies hade been an economic engine for those communities
a study by the brookings institution last year concluded that three dozen sports franchises from the nfl major league baseball national basketball association and national hockey league had financed stadiums since 2000 using taxexempt municipal bonds
the biggest beneficiary was not a football franchise but the new york yankees the presidents hometown baseball team which brookings estimated saved 492 million as a result among the football owners who have benefited from such bonds was mr trumps friend mr jones whose dallas cowboys saved 88 million in building att stadium
it was unclear how congress might prohibit states counties and cities from deciding how to spend their tax revenue or whether it could undo deals that were approved years ago it is also unclear whether it would be possible for legislators to target teams in one league like the nfl and not another like major league baseball
the federal government has limited room to act against the nfl in other areas the league has all but abandoned its policy of blacking out games in home markets when teams fail to sell out their stadiums giving the federal communications commission less oversight over professional football the league however does have something akin to an antitrust exemption thanks to a 1966 law that allows every team to band together to negotiate television deals
as part of his campaign against sports figures who have criticized him the president on tuesday hosted the nhl champions at the white house he invited the stanley cup winning pittsburgh penguins a day after disinviting the golden state warriors of the nba because its star stephen curry said he would vote against attending"

youve probably been told its dangerous to open unexpected attachment files in your email just like you shouldnt open suspicious packages in your mailbox but have you been warned against scanning unknown qr codes or just taking a picture with your phone new research suggests that cyberattackers could exploit cameras and sensors in phones and other devices
as someone who researches 3d modeling including assessing 3d printed objects to be sure they meet quality standards im aware of being vulnerable to methods of storing malicious computer code in the physical world our groups work is in the laboratory and has not yet encountered malware hidden in 3d printing instructions or encoded in the structure of an item being scanned but were preparing for that possibility
at the moment its not very likely for us an attacker would need very specialized knowledge about our systems functions to succeed in attacking it but the day is coming when intrusions can happen through normal communications with or sensing performed by a computer or smartphone product designers and users alike need to be aware of the risks
transmitting infection
in order for a device to become infected or compromised the nefarious party has to figure out some way to get the computer to store or process the malware the human at the keyboard has been a common target an attacker might send an email telling the user that he or she has won the lottery or is going to be in trouble for not responding to a work supervisor in other cases a virus is designed to be unwittingly triggered by routine software activities
researchers at the university of washington tested another possibility recently embedding a computer virus in dna the good news is that most computers cant catch an electronic virus from bad software called malware embedded in a biological one the dna infection was a test of the concept of attacking a computer equipped to read digital data stored in dna
similarly when our team scans a 3d printed object we are both storing and processing the data from the imagery that we collect if an attacker analyzed how we do this they could perhaps identify a step in our process that would be vulnerable to a compromised or corrupted piece of data then they would have to design an object for us to scan that would cause us to receive these data
closer to home when you scan a qr code your computer or phone processes the data in the code and takes some action perhaps sending an email or going to a specified url an attacker could find a bug in a codereader app that allows certain precisely formatted text to be executed instead of just scanned and processed or there could be something designed to harm your phone waiting at the target website
imprecision as protection
the good news is that most sensors have less precision than dna sequencers for instance two mobile phone cameras pointed at the same subject will collect somewhat different information based on lighting camera position and how closely its zoomed in even small variations could render encoded malware inoperable because the sensed data would not always be accurate enough to translate into working software so its unlikely that a persons phone would be hacked just by taking a photo of something
but some systems like qr code readers include methods for correcting anomalies in sensed data and when the sensing environment is highly controlled like with our recent work to assess 3d printing it is easier for an attacker to affect the sensor readings more predictably
what is perhaps most problematic is the ability for sensing to provide a gateway into systems that are otherwise secure and difficult to attack for example to prevent the infection of our 3d printing quality sensing system by a conventional attack we proposed placing it on another computer one disconnected from the internet and other sources of potential cyberattacks but the system still must scan the 3d printed object a maliciously designed object could be a way to attack this otherwise disconnected system
screening for prevention
many software developers dont yet think about the potential for hackers to manipulate sensed data but in 2011 iranian government hackers were able to capture a us spy drone in just this way programmers and computer administrators must ensure that sensed data are screened before processing and handled securely to prevent unexpected hijacking
in addition to developing secure software another type of system can help an intrusion detection system can look for common attacks unusual behavior or even when things that are expected to happen dont theyre not perfect of course at times failing to detect attacks and at others misidentifying legitimate activities as attacks
computer devices that both sense and modify the environment are becoming more common in manufacturing robots drones and selfdriving cars among many other examples as that happens the potential for attacks to include both physical and electronic elements grows significantly attackers may find it very attractive to embed malicious software in the physical world just waiting for unsuspecting people to scan it with a smartphone or a more specialized device hidden in plain sight the malicious software becomes a sort of sleeper agent that can avoid detection until it reaches its target perhaps deep inside a secure government building bank or hospital

"__label__fake losing the edge
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
like sacks losing the edge against the run is complex and often not attributable to a single player this was never more evident than in sundays loss to the steelers
the ravens had solid pressure on ben roethlisberger more about that later but lost the game by allowing a whopping 12 runs of 6 yards the bulk of which came to the outside
how did the steelers manage all this success on the edge in part the ravens miss their starters on the defensive interior brandon williams and brent urban they create significant penetration on run plays which make it difficult for other teams to succeed with the slowdeveloping flow plays which depend on pulls on which the steelers feasted
bronson kaufusi made his first nfl start and played 21 competitive snaps on those plays the steelers rushed 18 times for 101 yards 56 ypc by far the highest of any raven with 5 snaps and passed the ball just 3 times for 13 yards bronson did not make the stat sheet and made my notes just once q3 1455 for significant backfield penetration on a run play
carl davis had one note for backfield penetration and michael pierce had 2 one of those a missed tackle while each of them accumulated some tackles davis 3 pierce 7 they were also part of the problem with edge loss
the other significant contributing factor to losing the edge was effective blocking from the tes the steelers used bj finney as a 6th lineman on 15 snaps but vance mcdonald also made my notes with 4 key blocks on run plays
the ravens olbs did a poor job themselves but they were significantly outmanned on the edge
quick whistle
the ravens 3rdquarter comeback attempt was slowed significantly by the quick whistle which negated the pick6 by weddle as i understand it thats exactly the sort of play the officials are encouraged to allow to resolve by itself before using the whistle which kills the action
im also bothered that the call on the field the runners forward progress was stopped as opposed to down by contact was manufactured to whitewash the premature whistle forward progress calls are not reviewable
in any case jimmy smith made a fine play to deny the catch to brown which seemed to go unnoticed the ravens lost 4 points on the play and perhaps another on their later 2point conversion attempt a game that might have been 1914 remained 199
more pressure scheme
dean pees schemed for more pressure in this game the story of which is partially told by success with numbers
pees ratcheted blitzes up to 9 individual occurrences 5 webb 2 mosley 1 jefferson 1 correa i counted just 4 stunts which seems low given bens limited mobility but all of them came on plays with ample time and space ats
in total 4 of the 31 pas plays had a deceptive pass rush as i define it on the most successful of those q3 1333 the ravens brought a 5man overload including blitzes from webb jefferson and mosley from the offensive right side while dropping levine suggs and judon from the los to coverage roethlisberger threw right to brown jimmy smith prevented him from gaining control and the ball came loose for weddles interception detailed above
unfortunately when the ravens failed to get to roethlisberger he picked apart both man and zone coverages
individual notes by positional group
i should note here that i wont be reviewing the play of every player each week just some of the key performances good and bad which contributed to the outcome
please note my snap totals will typically be lower than other published sources such as pff or the nfl gamebook because i exclude kneels spikes accepted penalties which result in no play and special teams plays that result in run or pass
defensive line
the ravens again activated 5 defensive linemen with kaufusi replacing urban they played a combined 153 snaps spread over 72 competitive plays 213 per snap
willie henry 28 snaps was used primarily in passing situations on 15 pass snaps he had a significant personal contribution including 2 pds and 2 qhs he also drew a holding flag on decastro on the first drive both qhs and 1 pd came opposite the steelers pro bowl rg however his most impressive play of the day was elevating for his 2nd pd q4 1253 versus a double team from lg foster and c pouncey this was a big step forward for henry in terms of pressure generation and hes earned more play in passing situations
michael pierce 58 snaps was again utilized heavily i scored him for just 1 pressure in 19 pass snaps he had 6 run stuffs among 7 tackles but as i mentioned above the ravens needed backfield penetration from him williams and urban to derail the steelers constant pulls
linebackers
the ravens activated all 9 of their linebackers 5 olbs 4 ilbs all but the newly acquired jonathan freeny saw action on defense
onwuasor up correa down
kamalei correa 27 snaps started and was credited with 2 tackles
 q1 311 he took down bell after a gain of 16 where vance mcdonald drove him backward to lead the play
 q3 1455 he was last to the scrum on a play where kaufusi backed up te james to shut down bell for a gain of 1
patrick onwuasor 31 snaps did not start but made the greater personal contribution as the positional battle at ilb dragged from the preseason to week 4 of the regular season to summarize
 q1 228 peanut blew up connors run right for a loss of 2 although carr got tackle credit
 q2 1403 he delivered a jarring hit on brown to take him down for a gain of just 2 on a meandering wr screen that started on the left side tackle credit was wiped out when the ravens accepted an illegal block by pouncey on davis
 q2 1226 despite ats ben overthrew bell by the right sideline with onwuasor in tight coverage to deny 3rd and 4
 q3 758 he chased down connor for a loss of 2 from the backside on what appeared to be a wellblocked play headed for a big gain to the left it was reminiscent of lewis chasing down barber in super bowl xxxv
 q4 1417 he contained bell for a gain of 2 on a run right where mosley was given tackle credit
 q4 401 he and mosley shot opposite a gaps to take down the stutterstepping bell who was looking for a hole again mosley got the tackle credit
this was onwuasors best game as a pro but pees may continue to alternate at the will until one of them outplays the other for several straight weeks or one makes an egregious error
cj mosley all 72 snaps had some effective penetration on run plays including 2 tackles for loss but he needed more supporting help roethlisberger picked on him for several times when he could get him in solo coverage including
 q2 542 mosley was beaten by te james on an 18yard cross
 q2 155 neither mosley or levine was close to bell who made an 18yard play 0 18 yac between the hashes
 q2 045 he was beaten by smithschuster on an 11yard cross 6 5 yac between the hashes
 q3 923 smithschuster caught a 17yard pass on the right side between him and webb
its quite possible mosley would not be as much of a target playing for a team with a less talented secondary
tyus bowser 6 snaps generated a pressure q3 409 that helped deny 3rd and 18 he was last among the olbs in snaps
tim williams 20 snaps got an extended trial much of which came on 1st and 2nd down he played only 2 snaps on 3rd down i assume the extended play from williams was an attempt to generate more pressure with his quickness and that was a success among 11 pass snaps he played a significant role in 3 events
 q1 631 williams beat lt villanueva to the outside forcing bell to pick him up that allowed webb blitzing off the slot left to slide by unblocked to sack roethlisberger for a loss of 8
 q4 1339 tim bulled villanueva for pressure
 q4 949 he violently disengaged to the inside from rt hubbard for a pressure as ben overthrew bryant in the end zone i will review this play to see if it was actually a qh when the coaches film is released
like all the olbs williams was also steamrolled by pulls
matthew judon 39 snaps had 2 pressures on 16 pass rush snaps which wasnt enough given he was up against the emergency starting rt hubbard for a number of those snaps
zadarius smith 48 snaps knocked down roethlisberger 3 times and generated a pressure but negated much of the value with a big roughing the passer foul q3 518 smith was twice sealed by te mcdonald and once by rb watson on run plays to his side he also failed to close the b gap on a play where he disengaged from decastros block q1 311
terrell suggs 45 snaps was perhaps the most disappointing of the olbs he didnt generate a single pressure on 20 pass snaps and made just 1 tackle i loved his entrance since this is his 2nd equipment violation of this type my overunder on the fine is 25000 he knows hell be fined but he did it to get the crowd involved thats not selfserving ochocincostyle prop comedy it was a teamfirst gesture
secondary
i dont have a lot of individual play to highlight in the secondary but the ravens shutdown of antonio brown is worth mention brown has played 72 games playoffs included since the beginning of 2013 and hes only been held to less than 39 yards twice 24 yards on 101815 vs arizona and 34 yards on 10117 vs baltimore
marlon humphrey 26 snaps had a further extension of playing time primarily as a replacement for jimmy smith for the first time this season he gave up consecutive long passes
 q2 123 bryant beat him on a skinny post for a gain of 24 159 between the hashes
 q2 057 bryant again beat him for a 19yard play 18 1 yac between the numbers and right hash
he had outstanding coverage of brown 25 yards down the left sideline q2 1024 with a bracket from weddle that fell incomplete marlon had a missed tackle versus the run q2 1019 he also beat the puling decastro to shut down the left edge q2 759 in support of mosleys tackle for a loss of 4 the ravens continued their freakish success with him on the field 45 ypp vs 58 ypp with him on the sideline vs the steelers for the season the ravens have allowed 34 ypp with him on and 58 ypp with him out this is particularly interesting since he plays rotationally by series and not in particular downanddistance situations like levine and webb
defensive stars of the game

strip an economy of capital productive incentives talent and yes ethics and what are we left with an economy spiraling toward an inevitable collapse
financialization is destroying the real economy but few in power seem to notice or care the reason why is painfully obvious those in power are reaping vast fortunes from the engines of financializationfor example former president obama obama goes from white house to wall street in less than one year
this is not to single out president obama as a special case politicos across the spectrum depend on the engines of financialization to fund their campaigns and make them multimillionaires and corporate managers and financiers have skimmed billions of dollars in gains not from producing new better and more affordable goods and services but by playing financialization games such as borrowing billions to buy back stocks leveraged buyouts and so onall of which have reaped the insiders gargantuan fortunes while hollowing out the real economy
financialization necessarily hollows out the real economy as gordon long and i detail in this new video program the results of financialization part i 34 minutes
the key dynamic is that financialization creates irresistible incentives to ramp up debt and leverage at the expense of the real economy those who fail to exploit financialization will underperform the market and be fired
as gordon explains if a ceo refuses to load a company up with debt a privateequity financier with access to cheap federal reserve credit will scoop up the company in a private buyout fire the management extract immense profits by loading the company with debt then take the hollowedout shell public again reaping another windfall of financialized gains
note that the privateequity financiers have every incentive to lay off employees especially experienced workers who earn higher salaries to reduce costs before they take the hollowedout shell public how can corporations pay out more to shareholders than they actually earned easyfinancialization another key dynamic in financialization is limitless liquidity and super low interest rates set by central banksrates that are so low and liquidity so abundant that corporations can roll over their debt and actually add more debt and keep their interest payments unchanged
this dynamic inevitably leads to zombie corporationscorporations with low rates of growth and profitability and high debt loads that in an unfinancialized economy would be recognized as insolvent and liquidated
as we explain financialization skews the riskreward in favor of financial games so realworld investments no longer make sense why risk building a factory in the us or training workers when the payoff is uncertain when there are so many ways to reap immense fortunes via financial games that are ultimately backstopped by the federal reserve or federal agencies ie the taxpayers
as many observers have noted these perverse incentives have siphoned human talent away from productive employment and into enormously wellcompensated but parasitic exploitative financializationrelated jobs
strip an economy of capital productive incentives talent and yes ethics and what are we left with an economy spiraling toward an inevitable collapse the metaphor ive used to explain this in the past is the yellowstone forest fire the deadwood of bad debt extreme leverage zombie companies and all the other fallen branches of financialization pile up but the central banks no longer allow any creative destruction of unpayable debt and misallocated capital every brush fire is instantly suppressed with more stimulus more liquidity and lower interest rates
as a result the deadwood sapping the real economy of productivity and innovation is allowed to pile higher
the only possible output of this suppression is an economy piled high with explosive risk eventually nature supplies a lightning strike and the resulting conflagration consumes the entire economy
i explain all this in greater detail in my short book why our status quo failed and is beyond reform

behind it the stage with the lighting rig is also in view the scene of sundays massacre appears almost untouched as you gaze across the busy highway two broken windows on the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay hotel break up the otherwise smooth gold facade of the building
it is hard to even imagine how gunfire could have travelled so far from such a great height and distance on innocent concertgoers
the hotel itself has reopened a queue of people wait to check in at the marble counters others sit at slot machines doing what people do best here
outside on the boulevard a makeshift memorial is growing in size as people bring candles flowers and photos and write messages of love with chalk
the motto of this city is what goes on here stays here that mantra rings true now the tragedy of sunday night will never be forgotten but people are resilient and determined to move on

chicago police said they were looking into reports that paddock booked a hotel room in august overlooking the lollapalooza music festival in the illinois city
former president barack obamas daughters were among the thousands of revellers
it has also emerged that a week before his massacre paddock booked into a central las vegas apartment
it was in a highrise tower overlooking another openair concert life is beautiful where acts included muse lorde and chance the rapper

2218 security guard on 32nd floor tells police he has been shot and points them to room
2320 swat teams enter gunmans room they find one suspect down getty
paddock who was gambling just hours before he began shooting had set up cameras both inside and outside the mandalay bay hotel suite to see anyone approaching the room police said
sheriff lombardo added anything that would indicate this individuals trigger point and that would cause him to do such harm we havent understood it yet
what did paddocks girlfriend say
marilou danley who was out of the country at the time of the shooting has been described by us authorities as a person of interest
she voluntarily flew back to los angeles from the philippines on tuesday night to speak to the fbi
two weeks ago she said paddock surprised her with a plane ticket to visit her family in the south east asian country
paddock never said anything to me or took any action which she understood as a warning of what was to come she said in a statement read by her lawyer
ms danley added i loved him and hoped for a quiet future together 
while she was in the philippines he wired her 100000 75400 saying it was to buy a house
i was grateful but honestly i was worried it was a way for him to break up with me she said
it never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone
her sister earlier told australian outlet 7news that ms danley was sent away so that she will not be there to interfere with what hes planning
paddock checked into a suite in the mandalay bay hotel on 28 september reportedly using some of ms danleys identity documents

will the attack lead to gun control
particularly bad us mass shootings typically spark renewed calls for gun control measures which tend to falter as the public horror fades and the lobbying might of the national rifle association is brought to bear on congress
but some republicans have said they might be open to the idea of banning a fully legal firearms accessory used by paddock to such deadly effect

twitter and instagram are sometimes nuts and to be honest i am considering removing bleeding yankee blue from twitter all together i feel bad about that because the majority of the yankee and byb fans i have built a relationship with are very good smart people and the dialog we have is tremendous but theres a lot of hate out there and when you break it down you realize these haters dont really have lives live behind their screens and know that no ones gonna come after them or bother them and they can bully whomever they want its kind of sick and demented

opinions matter though especially if its smart opinion and relevant to a situation especially if you keep it clean and you know what after friday nights devastating loss people were annoyed and aggravated and wanted answers as to why girardi didnt challenge the hit by pitch that eventually led to a grand slam and the indians beating the yanks it will haunt joe forever if the yankees dont win this series thats for sure
now look i found this snipe by aroldis chapman fascinating and to be honest it sends a message to his manager
ill let the new york daily news take it from here
if yankee fans think joe girardis tenure as manager should be coming to an end it seems aroldis chapman might like that idea
the bombers closer liked a comment on his instagram page early saturday morning insinuating that girardi shouldnt return as skipper in 2018
lets hope joes contract is not renewed after the season the comment chapman liked written by user millsjr33 reads hes an imbecile
photo getty images
does that form a struggle in the yankee clubhouse now absolutely but so did girardis lack of leadership the other night will chapman be reprimanded sure he should punished absolutely does he care nope
and heres the thing i side with chapman here sometimes you need to send a message to management that things arent being handled correctly sometimes you need to remind them that they need to be there for the team and not sit on your hands and do nothing the lack of challenge the other night was not joes style and that was weird to me
photo getty images
hes been aggressive and backing his team all year but not the other night
he pulled cc too early he didnt challenge and the binder thinking started creeping in
chapman sent a message i dont care that reports are that he apologized and that the team said he did it accidently what i do know is it got people talking and regardless of the apology and team statement on the matter it was done intentionally
now its joes move

moscow reuters russian tycoons mikhail prokhorov and viktor vekselberg have sold a 3 percent stake in russian aluminum giant rusal via an accelerated bookbuilding abb for 315 million one of their bookrunners said on wednesday
the deal came less than a week after russias en group which owns a 48 percent stake in rusal said it would launch an initial public share offering in london and moscow
the abb offering of about 456 million shares was priced at the lower end of the range of hk540hk555 with a 75percent discount to the predeal market price the bookrunner said
rusal shares fell 7 percent in hong kong on wednesday but are still up more than 65 percent since the start of 2017
prokhorov sold 07 percent in hong konglisted rusal and vekselberg sold 23 percent reducing their stakes in the company to 6 percent and 205 percent respectively goldman sachs and renaissance capital were the joint bookrunners
the deal could increase the liquidity of rusals shares in moscow and make it easier for rusal to be included in the prestigious msci russia index investment bank bcs has said
assuming that the placement was made into an open market the free float of rusal has increased to 164 percent but its inclusion in the msci index in november is unlikely vtb capital said in a note on wednesday

"__label__real london reuters a tough line from president donald trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of irans political divide uniting hardliners who cast the united states as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the west
iran which has kept up a steady drumbeat of angry statements for days lashed out again on tuesday threatening to teach the americans new lessons and keep all options on the table if washington blacklists its revolutionary guards
trump who has accused his predecessor barack obama of being too soft on iran is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week likely to include decertifying a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on tehrans nuclear programme such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement leaving that decision to congress
trump is also expected to designate irans most powerful security force the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc as a terrorist organisation the irgc has a vast economic empire in iran and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for iranian businesses to access the global financial system
it seems the trump administration understands only swear words and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world said iranian armed forces spokesman masoud jazayeri who is also a revolutionary guards commander
the americans have driven the world crazy by their behaviour it is time to teach them a new lesson
several iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on tuesday the urbane useducated foreign minister mohammad javad zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the irgc majorgeneral mohammad ali jafari in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of irans leadership
we have a similar stance but different ways of saying it the papers quoted jafari as saying
related coverage uk reaffirms commitment to iran nuclear deal in call with trump mays office
irans moderate president hassan rouhani won reelection less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home openly criticising the influence of the irgc which he accused of backing his hardline opponent but the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad
the americans are too small to be able to harm the revolutionary guards ali akbar velayati the top adviser to iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei was quoted as saying by isna we have all options on the table whatever they do we will take reciprocal measures
us sanctions on the irgc could affect conflicts in iraq and syria where tehran and washington both support warring parties that oppose the islamic state militant group is
russia irans ally that is also fighting is in iraq and syria said on tuesday that it does not consider the revolutionary guards to be a terrorist organisation
islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc commander mohammad ali jafari l and irans foreign minister mohammad javad zarif smile during a coordination meeting for the 40th anniversary of the islamic revolution in tehran iran october 9 2017 tasnim news agencyhandout via reuters
firm decisive and crushing
the iranian nuclear deal backed by european countries china and russia lifted broad international sanctions over irans nuclear programme that had been tightened during the obama years and had caused severe damage to irans economy
but washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over tehrans ballistic missile programme and over allegations that it supports terrorism the lingering us sanctions have slowed irans reemergence into the world economy making global banks reluctant to take on business with iranian firms despite the nuclear deal
the united states already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting irgc activities but not the guards themselves designating the guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists

irans rial has dropped against the us dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about trumps policy the rial was quoted in the free market around 40400 to the dollar currency exchangers in tehran told reuters compared to 39200 last week several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market
the government told iranians on tuesday it would not let the decisions of the mentally unstable trump affect the market
trump might say some things by the end of the week but this should not create chaos in the market iran is a stable country and nothing will happen government spokesman mohammad baqer nobakht said in a weekly news conference
irans central bank governor valiollah seif was also quoted as saying by tasnim news agency that trumps words might have an emotional impact on the foreign exchange market but it would not be longterm
washington aims to put more pressure on the irgc especially over its missile programme trump said in september that recent irgc missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal
iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile programme
zarif the iranian foreign minister said iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact as it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations
in an article published in the atlantic magazine on monday zarif added no party or country need fear our missiles unless it intends to attack our territory"

so what is the secret of this bacteria well bacillus f has managed to survive for millions of years in the arctic tundra of siberia a place known to be one of the most extreme places on earth
 
as global warming spreads across siberia the permafrost has started melting and this broushjov believes has caused the bacteria to infiltrate into the natural environment getting into the water supply of local populations he believed that there would be no danger in experimenting on himself as he claims the yakut people have been imbibing the bacteria naturally for some time and this race seems to have greater longevity despite their hard living conditions i started to work longer ive never had the flu for the last two years he told the siberian times
 
as with many scientific discoveries it is not always easy to determine how something works and in the case of bacillus f broushkov claims it is the same however he will continue to conduct the experiments under scientific conditions to discover the impact and of course to identify potential sideeffects
 
if we can find how the bacteria stays alive we probably would be able to find a tool to extend our lives he explained in an interview
 
this jurassic bacterium could also be an integral factor in fertility as well as longevity in humans say the scientists older female mice that were injected with bacillus f were able to reproduce after they had ceased being able to also bacillus f also can heal plants
 
claimed to be akin to discovering the holy grail dr viktor chernyavsky an epidemiologist from yakutsk said the bacteria gives out biologically active substances throughout its life which activates the immune status of experimental animals

1 a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust
heres the full verse we better give obama props cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops and he waits for s to quiet down hell just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops

maybe the question of why isnt as important as it seems because if youre looking for a common denominator between abby eileen darlene ashley and all the other women on the show its the struggle to assert themselves in a world thats dominated by men darlene and ashley have pimps so the limits on their freedom are obvious but this episode also emphasizes how abby and eileen two freelancers in this milieu are boxed in too eileen is working hard to make a transition into the movie business but in the meantime she cant extricate herself from prostitution or conceive of how to make an ordinary romantic relationship with jack work its an important detail that the terrible beating she takes from a client isnt the first or the worst and certainly not the last this one scary incident doesnt alone have the power to push her into a new life
as for abby she hasnt been easy to read because the full purpose of her character on the show has yet to be revealed but the amount of control she feels she possesses over her life doesnt quite jibe with the reality of it by sleeping with vinnie she gains some leverage over him but he bristles at her confrontation with reggie love and insists that shes not exempt from wearing the same signature leotards as the other waitresses
she also finds the door closing on her former life she slips away with her college friends for a party but then she feels out of place and leaves before everyone decides whether to see straw dogs or play misty for me shes now fully part of this insular world of pimps prostitutes gangsters and societal castaways that david simon george pelecanos and their writers and directors have so carefully laid out and no one ever leaves

naturally americans are up in arms because a bunch of folks who get paid millions of dollars to throw around a leather ball decided to kneel during the national anthem i find this ironic for several reasons
first off id like to clarify that choosing not to watch football because someone did something you disagree with is entirely your choice and your choice alone just like nfl players can make the decision to kneel during the anthem you can make the decision to change the channel its called freedom it is awesome and i highly recommend it
that being said id like to draw attention to two points one being the idea of a country whose leader shames others and calls for the termination of their employment for practicing their right to disagree with the government and two why are people so upset over a bunch of kneeling millionaires
donald trump was well within his right to say whatever he wants about the nfl players up to and including calling for the nfl to fire them its called freedom and you dont have to like it to participate in it but if trump really wanted the players to start standing up for the anthem calling for them to be fired is not only on the verge of tyrannical but its nowhere close to a solution
respect is earned it is not mandated through threats or abuse of power or forced through the barrel of a gun if there was one thing i learned in the marine corps its that good leaders are ones that lead by example those leaders who demanded respect without first earning it were the reason for me turning down a 5figure taxfree reenlistment bonus to stay in
leaders and i use that term loosely who want something from you and dont have the common decency or fortitude to first apply themselves and find a peaceful and mutually beneficial way to get it are not leading by example and deserve no respect sadly in america leaders havent done these things in a long time in america through propaganda and fear our leaders are demanding and mandating respectwithout earning it this is the definition of tyranny
if donald trump really wanted the football players to start standing during the national anthem then he should ask them what it is they want if the dozens of millionaires taking knees cant articulate a rational and well thought out list of requests then they are merely publicity hounds buying into the divide colin kaepernick could do this and hes has taken action to try to resolve his grievances
im not quite sure all these other nfl players would be such good leaderslike kaepernickif asked what it is they want
if its police brutality they are protesting where were most of these folks when obama was in office its not like police brutality and racist policing practices suddenly became an issue once trump took over in 2017 where were all these nfl players when obama was filling prisons with black people for possessing a plant where were all these nfl players when obama continued to wage the drug war which is proven to lay far more waste to the rights of those with darker skin than to those with lighter skin outside of just a few of them they were nowhere to be found thats where
that brings me to my second pointthe folks who are angry at these football players taking kneesbecause it disrespects our country our troops and our veterans again these folks have every right to voice their opinion be angry and boycott the nfl its called freedom and its awesome and i highly recommend it
that being said if a person taking a knee during a song is disrespectful to our troops and veterans what exactly is it considered when 307000 of those veterans die waiting for care they were promised by this country if a person taking a knee during a song is disrespectful to those who fought for our country what is it considered when that country looks the other way when there over 40000 of those veterans living on the streets with no home if taking a knee at a football game is disrespectful what then is it considered when americans remain silent as a veteran kills himself or herself every 65 minutes every single day every single month of every single year
if this song and flag represent the land of the free and people kneeling down makes others angry because it is an insult to that freedom then how does one view the nsa surveillance grid is a person taking a knee worse than the united states of america creating the largest spying network the world has ever seenone that the stasi wouldve killed forand using it on innocent americans
is a person kneeling more offensive than the tsa groping babies cancer patients the elderly and the disabled despite never stopping a terror attack is a knee more offensive to freedom than the united states creating maintaining and financing the largest prison population the world has ever seen through the enforcement of victimless crimes
is a rich football player kneeling really that much more offensive than the commander in chief making one of the largest weapons deals in the history of the us with the largest state sponsor of terror in the world saudi arabia is a knee more offensive than calling saudi arabia our ally after they were exposed for financing the horrific attacks on 911
where is the outrage call me a traitor call me unpatriotic call me whatever you want tell me to move to somalia and eat shit and die becausefreedom baby however ill always stand against tyranny even if that means pissing people off for telling the truth in an empire of lies telling the truth is a revolutionary and often hated act
if we can agree on one thing in this sea of vitriol and disagreement let us remember that this country was born through protest slavery ended because of protest the declaration of independence was a protest it was not orderfollowing and blind compliance that created americait was disobedience

to know freedom is to know nature living in harmony with nature leads to peace prosperity knowledge truth action and freedom nature reflects the order of the universe living in opposition to nature leads to war control ignorance fear stagnation and enslavement
today america the land of the free and home of the brave finds herself in shackles and homeless the foundation of american freedom is cracked new restrictive mandates form the walls of a prison cell which we have built through our own apathy and ignorance the original charters of freedom the united states constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence were written to reflect inherent rights of the individual yet these documents are being ignored by the very government created to uphold them because by themselves they are only metaphorical shields
why are we losing freedom
because we have forgotten where our rights come from human rights are natural and inborn granted by the creator they come from our humanity under the laws of nature natural law and justice is and always has been the primary fundamental force in the universe it is a body of universal spiritual laws which governs consciousness consciousness creates through each of us using free will we are consciousness
we have stopped taking action to secure freedom we thought that when we created government in america as a constitutional republic individuals would be recognized to hold certain inalienable rights rights which are not transferable and which can never be revoked regardless of what the majority wants or who holds power however what we have agreed to is a democracy
a republic is where the people control the government a democracy is where the government controls the people
when rights are legalized
rights granted and legalized by governments are not rights at all in fact they are privileges that can be altered restricted and taken away by legislation or executive orders
these privileges are codified codes in legalese legalese is the language of statutes which redefines words as tools to expand the scope and power of the state under statutes a person is a legal fiction not a human being with free will at the same time a corporation is defined as a number of persons united in one body so it can acquire wealth expand and enjoy other rights note a corporation is incapable of loyalty or love governments also regulate behavior through licensure a license is permission to do something otherwise deemed to be illegal
a government that gives itself power by its own authority is a rogue government and must be restrained or else the trend is toward a concentration of power where laws are homogenized and standardized to oneopinion rule a monarchy unless we can wake ourselves up the united nations un international treaties uncrc intend to reduce inequality by implementing new norms of global socialism and corporate fascism as part of their post2015 sustainable development goals
what is freedom
to go to the next level in human evolution is to return more deeply into nature that is where freedom lives freedom is our ability to
express without limits
to seek truth and understanding
to access the foods of our choice
to choose what we allow into our bodies and our minds
to grow our own foods and plant medicines
to speak our truth
to raise children without government interference
to choose love instead of fear
to choose healing over treatment
to embody and integrate the charters of freedom
to claim responsibility for individual choices and the consequences of those choices
how few of us have made our individual declaration of independence and until we do that we are not free edwin manners
the american declaration of independence reminds us
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation
when governments ignore the will of the people and go rogue for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many it is time to remember from where true freedom comes our system derives from our free will and consent
the polarity principle
there are two belief systems representing the polarity existing on planet earth under the polarity principle everything has poles or pairs of opposite charge
one belief system says that a human being is separate from all others designed to control others when they cannot or do not reason for themselves this belief derives from manmade written codes that must be learned
another belief system says that each human is a cell of the collective web and that all humans are connected as one entity one interconnected humanity this belief derives from natural law natural law is not written but intuitive and knowable by simple observation reason common sense and deduction by your action ye shall be known
on a freewill planet everything is presented as an offer to contract and it is always up to each of us to consent or to withdraw consent silence is acquiescence ignorance of the law is no excuse in the age of information
legal vs lawful
there is a difference between legal and lawful legal pertains to the letter of law whereas lawful pertains to the spirit of law legal matters reflect statutes between government entities and the color of law ie the appearance or semblance without the substance whereas lawful matters reflect common law the law of the landthe law of the peopleand are actual in nature not implied going forward if we are to be free we must resist playing a game of wits in a corrupt system that seeks to destroy inherent rights
instead we must take back the language and determine who we are are we a personcorporation or a soul embodied do we have freewill or do we ask for permission from an outside authority do we consent to the dictates of a rogue government or do we withdraw consent do we own our bodies or does the state do we recognize inalienable rights and act on them do we reclaim our sovereignty as freewill beings it is time to redefine the words we live by to work in our favor
free stormproof waterproof survival match kit ad true freedom for all should be seen as the goal of spiritual development such a state can only manifest as a result of human societys adherence to natural law mark passio natural law the real law of attraction
follow intuition
as part of nature we must connect to nature to experience freedom as within so without when we follow government dictates as truth we lose touch with our own intuition we lose connection with our true nature as long as we remain distracted debating the details of the system war mandates rigged elections the nfl science abortion selfidentification we are directionless lost in a maze of confusion by consenting to a system of contradictions through our participation and acceptance the system feeds off our energy
if america is held up as an example of freedom to the rest of the world we must get our act together and identify with natural law through the power of our vision we become the architect of the life we want to create for ourselves and for our families we only need to reclaim responsibility and act on it in order to see it emanate out to affect all life such is the law of nature
in the american system no government is sovereign the peoples of the states are the sovereigns it is they who apportion powers between themselves their state governments and the federal government in doing so they are not impairing their sovereignty in any way to the contrary they are exercising it tom woods tenth amendment center

"__label__real image copyright unicef image caption south sudan has been named as the worst place in the world for education for girls
debates about schools in richer countries are often about the politics of priorities what subjects should be given most importance who needs extra help and what needs more public spending
but for families in many developing countries questions about education can be a lot more basic is there any access to school at all
figures from the united nations suggest there has been almost zero progress in the past decade in tackling the lack of school places in some of the worlds poorest countries
a further report examined the quality of education and the un said the findings were staggering with more than 600 million children in school but learning next to nothing

while in affluent western countries girls are often ahead of boys in academic achievement in poorer parts of the world particularly subsaharan africa girls are much more likely to be missing out
and on the uns international day of the girl the development campaign one has created a ranking for the toughest places for girls to get an education
conflict zones
across these 10 countries most of those without school places are girls
these are fragile countries where many families are at risk from poverty ill health poor nutrition and displacement from war and conflict
image copyright reuters image caption refugees displaced by fighting this summer in south sudan
many young girls are expected to work rather than go to school and many marry young ending any chance of an education
un figures indicate girls are more than twice as likely to lose out on education in conflict zones
image copyright unicef image caption refugees in chad conflicts have disrupted the educations of tens of millions
the rankings are based on
the proportion of girls without a primary school place
the proportion of girls without a secondary school place
the proportion of girls completing primary school
the proportion of girls completing secondary school
the average number of years girls attend school
female illiteracy rates
teacher training levels
the teacherpupil ratio
public spending on education
for some countries such as syria there was insufficient reliable data for them to be included
here are the top 10 toughest places for girls education
south sudan the worlds newest country has faced much violence and war with the destruction of schools and families forced from their homes almost threequarters of girls do not even make it to primary school central african republic one teacher for every 80 pupils niger only 17 of women between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate afghanistan wide gender gap with boys more likely to be in school than girls chad many social and economic barriers to girls and women getting education mali only 38 of girls finish primary school guinea the average time in education among women over the age of 25 is less than one year burkina faso only 1 of girls complete secondary school liberia almost twothirds of primaryage pupils out of school ethiopia two in five girls are married before the age of 18
a shortage of teachers is a common problem across poorer countries

the las vegas massacre which had occurred on october 1 2017 and caused at least 58 people to die and more than 500 persons to become injured is the worst shooting tragedy to occur since the wounded knee creek massacre on december 29 1890 when us calvary troops were sent to disarm the lakota indians in south dakota that caused the deaths of 150 native americans and had wounded 51 men women and children the destruction of the lakota pine ridge indian reservation by us army soldiers may have caused the death toll to rise to at least 300 native americans because their living quarters warm clothing and food supplies no longer existed
 
just as every previous event or tragedy in america has never revealed the entire truth in such a short period of time it seems as if so little information has been released to the public and most of that socalled news seems to be rather uncertain for instance when law enforcement agents in las vegas were reported entering room 32135 on the 32nd hotel floor of the mandalay bay resort and casino they claimed to have found the dead body of steven paddock who allegedly was the lone shooter with an arsenal of long rifles and a multitude of ammunition magazines it is hard to imagine that mgm resorts international would have such inadequate security in this remodeled hotel bearing its name however by contrast we are led to believe that paddock had installed his own security cameras leading into the hallway to warn him before anyones arrival
 
at this time we have not received any conclusive evidence or information about this shooting if we did perhaps it might turn out that his dead body had been left in room 32135 after a series of fullyautomatic shooting machine guns had been removed and only ar15 semiautomatic gun types were displayed in an attempt to convince the public this defensive rifle must be banned
 
all we really know at this time is that at least 58 wonderful men women and children have died and more than 500 other americans were wounded by an undisclosed weapon apparently fired at a location from the mandalay bay in a room on the 32nd floor of the hotel but it has also become rather clear that our second amendment of the us constitution is being threatened by so many wellorganized members of various marxist groups and leftist factions of the news media who now intend to cause violence against us the american people after they are able to remove the only effective means for selfdefense take a good look at europe in terms of selfprotection it no longer exists in any european household except to some extent in switzerland"

"__label__real an unarmed security guard at las vegas mandalay bay resort and casino was the first to take on gunman stephen paddock getting shot in the process but providing crucial help for police looking to stop the massacre
the security guard identified as jesus campos by the international union security police and fire professionals of america was shot in the leg after paddock fired at him through a door police said
police said paddock managed to fire off over 200 rounds as the security guard approached the suspects room alone but the guard managed to direct police to the exact location of paddocks suite and even provided a hotel key to officers looking to clear rooms on the 32nd floor before they insisted he get medical attention
reached by phone wednesday night campos told abc news im fine
the guard who found the shooter and helped bring the massacre to an end said i was just doing my job
campos provided information over the phone that helped authorities locate the 32ndfloor room that paddock was firing from a spokesperson for the union said
drew angerergetty images
campos was on random patrol as a security officer at the hotel when he found the shooter said liliana rodriguez who identified herself as a coworker of campos at mandalay bay on a gofundme page she set up for him
any one of us could have been in the position he was in rodriguez wrote most importantly we are a home away from home and at the end of the day we are a team and we should all go home together
campos was unarmed when he engaged with paddock the union spokesperson confirmed which was first reported by the daily beast
speaking this evening clark county sheriff joseph lombardo praised campos saying he aided officers in their search for paddock
lombardo added that paddock fired well over 200 rounds into the hallway when the security guard approached paddock had set up a camera in the hallway apparently to watch for approaching authorities
its amazing that campos didnt sustain more injuries lombardo said
his bravery was amazing lombardo added he gave our officers the key card for the room and then continued clearing rooms until he was ordered to go seek attention
on sunday about 22000 concertgoers were attending the final night of the route 91 harvest festival on the las vegas strip across the street from the mandalay bay hotel when paddock began his deadly assault
it took authorities just minutes to locate where the bullets were coming from after the attack rang out once police breached the door to paddocks suite on the 32nd floor of the hotel they found him dead of an apparent selfinflicted gunshot wound
a total of 58 people were killed and 489 injured in the attack a motive is still not known but police said the shooting was obviously premeditated

"__label__fake betting on cs go with bitcoin
before its news
betting on cs go with bitcoin
online gambling can go two ways it can either be extremely safe or become very risky it all depends on the laws of the country or state that you reside in some countries dont care about where youre putting your money while others may just throw you in jail simply because you bet a penny on a counter strike go match
take for instance the united states since gambling is outlawed most people might prefer turning to the privacy offered by bitcoin rather than going for traditional currency
what is bitcoin
bitcoin is basically money that you buy with money since it works pretty much as if you just bought something online from whatever website how you use the product should be of no concern to anyone as a result you could use the bitcoins for esports bitcoin betting
however its still tricky law enforcement learned this trick and is sometimes stalking for bitcoin users as well traditional or online bitcoins are still coins and therefore its still considered money as a result you may sometimes have to download the betting software to evade any prying eyes
why go for bitcoins when playing cs go
there are many advantages to using bitcoin in esport betting a bitcoin gaming website for instance is much faster when you use traditional currencies most of the time youd have to wreck your nerves to make the payment official introduce your details get your acceptance make your transaction ensure that its legal this may be just enough to make you lose interest in the betting session and miss the match in the meantime
with bitcoin however you will only have to sign up using your email address you will rarely find any other transaction processing fees which means that the whole ordeal will be done rather quickly
furthermore if its not legal in your country you can make it legal the wonderful thing about the internet is the fact that it spreads worldwide and that includes countries where online gambling is not considered an issue
as a result you may be a us player struggling with the laws of your state but you could still be accepted on an outer website that allows players from the us since the website is not based on us grounds you may not be bound by the law
heres the kicker if you used the traditional money making the transaction would be all the more troublesome youd either have to make the conversion or hide from the law enforcement the fact that youre betting on a game using your bank account with bitcoin however most problems are done with bitcoins represent universal gaming currency so regardless of the country you wont have to go through many struggles its the same money but less of a headache
winning cs go skins
why do we bet during our counter strike go game plays its quite simple we never really bet because we want to cash in the money and use it in real life we bet because we want to use that money in the virtual world we want to buy the skins and weapons necessary to win the tournaments that cs go launches from time to time
well some betting websites want to make things even simpler for us instead of playing for money you are playing for skins they may only look fashionable and fancy but they are great help when it comes to protecting your hero in a cs go gameplay
these skins are also valuable in the real world you can trade them for all you want cash or bitcoins the choice of how you use the winnings is pretty much yours we bet on cs go because we want to be the winners so no matter if you use the prize to pimp your hero or pay your bread you have all the freedom esport betting is convenient this way
we are all gamblers at least to some extent if we dont take the risk we dont win even when your take your hero in cs go to some dark tavern you take a risk you have no idea who might creep up on you and end your game
when you are betting with bitcoin theres still some risk but the focus is on the risk of losing the bet rather than the risk of getting caught and thrown in jail its a method that is supposed to make your gaming experience a little more enjoyable and less stressful it will be lucrative and entertaining at the same time and if you are lucky it will also be rewarding give cs go betting a try and may the odds be forever in your favor"

london reuters the european union youth orchestra is moving to italy from london its home for more than 40 years in an early example of the cultural fallout from brexit
the prestigious organization which has worked with some of the worlds most famous conductors relies on eu funding which would almost certainly no longer be available to ukbased organizations after britain leaves the bloc in march 2019
the euyo is a vital cultural and political resource for europe and for the eu and i am delighted that the orchestras longterm stability has now been effected said vasily petrenko the orchestras chief conductor in a statement
the orchestra will move next year to new headquarters in rome and in the northern italian city of ferrara it said
its founding music director was the late italian conductor claudio abbado and it was invited to move to italy by culture minister dario franceschini
founded in london in 1976 it has been headquartered in the british capital ever since britain joined the precursor of what is now the eu in 1973
the orchestra auditions every year for new members who must be aged between 16 and 26 and come from an eu member country
its website says that british musicians are still eligible to apply this autumn to join the orchestra in 2018 when britain will still be a member
the arrangement for future years will depend on the details of the agreement negotiated between the eu and the uk it says
britains decision in a june 2016 referendum to leave the bloc was a severe blow to many in the arts world where crossborder collaboration and the ability to tour freely around europe are valued particularly highly"

"__label__real image copyright epa image caption proindependence demonstrations have continued following sundays referendum
spains constitutional court has suspended next mondays session of the catalan parliament in a bid to preempt a possible push for independence
the court said such a move would be a breach of the constitution
earlier prime minister mariano rajoy warned catalonias regional government against declaring independence after a disputed vote last sunday
catalan leader carles puigdemont had indicated that he could make such a declaration at next weeks session
the courts ruling on thursday upheld a challenge not from the government in madrid but by the socialists party of catalonia which opposes secession from spain
allowing the regional parliament to meet and declare independence the court said would violate the rights of the partys mps
an earlier ruling by the court aimed at stopping sundays vote was ignored by catalonias leaders that challenge to the court had come from spains government which condemned the referendum as illegal

rajoys gambit
analysis by bbc europe editor katya adler madrid
mariano rajoy is famous for his waitandsee attitude in crises hes more of a technocrat than a passionate politician so far its served him well while not wildly popular he remains very much in control of spains central government
but the catalan question is risky for him his apparent inertia this week is coming under fire from the spanish left who want him to start a dialogue with catalan separatists and the harder right who want him to take immediate action shutting the catalan government down bringing the reins of power back to madrid spaniards call it the nuclear option
in a nod to them on thursday mr rajoy warned of greater damage if catalan separatists went ahead with a unilateral declaration of independence spains constitutional court has now banned mondays meeting of the catalan parliament where that declaration was expected to be made
while this may appear a setback for the separatists they have ignored court rulings before but mr rajoy hopes the weight of spanish law will now serve to divide catalonias proindependence parties which range from the moderate to the radical and weaken their resolve

"__label__real strachan has been scotland head coach since january 2013
scotland boss gordon strachan said his team were genetically behind after they missed out on a world cup playoff place with a 22 draw in slovenia
victory in ljubljana would have made the scots one of the eight best secondplaced finishers but slovakia edged them out on goal difference
we had to pick a team to combat their height and strength said strachan who would not be drawn on his future
its a problem for us because we have to work harder for every ball
leigh griffiths shot scotland into a firsthalf lead in slovenia but substitute roman bezjak scored twice from setpieces to put the hosts in front
robert snodgrass netted a late leveller after darren fletcher spurned a wonderful chance but it was not enough as slovakia cruised to an expected home win over malta
genetically we are behind said strachan in the last campaign we were the second smallest apart from spain
maybe we get big women and men together and see what we can do
scotlands starting xi in ljubljana were more than three centimetres smaller than their opponents on average
and strachan said they had been unable to combat slovenias height and strength at setplays
nobody can tell me that apart from one player they are technically better than our players he said but physically we have a problem
we can fight it battle it and get through games on sheer determination and workrate and that takes a lot out of you
thats what happened tonight these guys have put so much into this i really feel for them but they can also be really pleased
this group is as good as anything ive worked with
strachans side had four points after four games of their qualifying campaign following a calamitous home draw with lithuania and heavy defeats in slovakia and england
they finished with a sixgame unbeaten run including four victories but it was not enough to finish as runnersup to runaway group f winners england
strachan 60 said it was an honour to work with this group
the players are hurting badly but when they look back they can be proud they gave it a right good shot he said
they left nothing in the dressing room over the last two games especially
weve been beaten on goal difference by slovakia who are an excellent side
leigh griffiths opened the scoring for scotland but the visitors could not find the win they needed
noone hurts like the players
former celtic and middlesbrough boss strachan who has been in charge since january 2013 said now was not the time to discuss his future
noone is hurting like the players its impossible he said the fans cant hurt like that i cant hurt
there shouldnt be any talk about what im thinking or what im doing at this moment in time because i am just looking after them
sometimes in life you have to hurt badly before you achieve things i have been lucky enough to achieve things with other groups of lads but these have achieved as much as anybody
i have never been in a dressing room as silent as that that was a real hurting silence
i really have to thank them for the effort they have put in"

the 28yearold will face a semifinal against wba champion george groves or fellow briton jamie cox who meet at wembley arena on 14 october
eubank jr beaten only once in his previous 26 bouts put the undefeated yildirim 26 on one knee in round one
after a flurry of punches a crunching left hook provided the knockout blow
following his emphatic victory eubank jr said im here to dominate this tournament im sending a message out there that im coming george groves get through your next fight so we can give the boxing fans what they want to see
i think its going to be exactly the same as what we saw tonight im not playing any more
asked about yildirim the briton added he was a strong comeforward fighter but the experience is not there for him
he was 160 but he has to work technically on his abilities to compete with a fighter like me
trouble mars contest
trouble broke out in the crowd before the eubank jryildirim bout
the contest took place at the hannsmartinschleyer halle in stuttgart germany and before the fighters took to the ring there was briefly trouble among rival fans
chairs and punches were thrown and pictures posted on social media showed some men left bloodied
journalist declan taylor who was covering the fight posted on social media mass brawl has just broken out literally 10ft from press row chairs over peoples heads the lot
what is the world boxing super series
the world boxing super series has been described as the champions league of boxing with two tournaments one for cruiserweights and one for supermiddleweights
each category offers a 25m 19m prize fund and a trophy named after late boxing great muhammad ali with the winner of each expected to receive 10m 76m in total over the three victories needed to land the title
world championship belts are also on the line in the new event so eubank jr who weighed in a pound under the 12st limit recorded by his opponent remains ibo world supermiddleweight champion
eubank jrs only defeat was a controversial splitdecision loss to compatriot billy joe saunders at middleweight in november 2014"
"__label__real washington reuters us president donald trump said on wednesday he was open to bilateral trade pacts with either canada or mexico if a threeway deal cannot be reached to substantially revise the north american free trade agreement
asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with canada if nafta talks sour with mexico trump said oh sure absolutely its possible we wont be able to reach a deal with one or the other but in the meantime well make a deal with one
trump added that a very creative deal was still possible to benefit all three countries
trumps comments came at a white house meeting with canadian prime minister justin trudeau who was in washington to promote naftas benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near washington
asked about trumps comments at a news conference later trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact
i continue to believe in nafta so saying we are ready for anything and we will continue to work diligently to protect canadian interests trudeau said
trudeau added that canada was very much aware of and very braced for trumps unpredictability but his government would work in a thoughtful meaningful way towards getting a good deal
mexican economy minister ildefonso guajardo speaking on mexican radio praised trumps comments as very balanced to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution
the us chamber of commerce on tuesday accused trumps administration of trying to sabotage the talks with poison pill proposals including demands for more favorable treatment for the us side on car production and a sunset clause to force regular negotiations
in his appearance with trudeau trump said well see what happens when asked whether nafta was doomed
its possible we wont be able to make a deal and its possible that we will he said well see if we can do the kind of changes that we need we have to protect our workers and in all fairness the prime minister wants to protect canada and his people also
us president donald trump welcomes canadas prime minister justin trudeau on the south lawn before their meeting about the nafta trade agreement at the white house in washington us october 11 2017 reutersjonathan ernst
us commerce secretary wilbur ross one of trumps top trade advisers downplayed the chances that a nafta termination would become necessary
we dont hope it will we dont desire that it will we dont believe that it will but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward ross said
but us and mexican corporate chief executives gathered in mexico city said they would be better off with no nafta than be saddled with a bad agreement
aggressive proposals
slideshow 10 images
trade experts said the nafta talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive us attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts
people briefed on us proposals to be presented this week said washington was seeking to sharply lift north american content threshold in car manufacturing
the proposals call for north american content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 625 percent in addition the united states wants to add a new 50 percent usspecific content requirement something that was not in the earlier agreements
these will be met with widespread opposition from canada and mexico i think its just a bridge too far said wendy cutler the asia societys washington policy director and former chief us negotiator for the transpacific partnership trade deal canceled by trump
the us side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production including electronics from asia but mexico strongly opposes a usspecific content requirement which would limit the growth of its own car industry
the difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks according to a schedule obtained by reuters the negotiations were extended on wednesday by two days to oct 17
other us proposals opposed by canada mexico and us business interests include the fiveyear sunset provision radical changes to naftas dispute arbitration systems changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for us seasonal produce growers
us trade representative robert lighthizer said on wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous us trade deals to ensure certain rights and transparency under each nations competition laws"

"__label__fake monday morning thoughts jets top jaguars
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
the best way to describe the win over jax is an ugly entertaining roller coaster ride the jet oline was the major factor in this physical phone booth game lets take a look
 a scrappy feisty and resilient effort because there were plenty of opportunities to hang their heads is this team developing an identity
 have we seen the last of matt forte with the dynamic performances of bilal powell and elijah mcguire can the coaching staff really take reps away from them and give them to a 31 year old rb what a pleasure to have rbs that are always a threat to break off 50 yard runs
 excellent game by the entire oline as they dominated the jax front and generated over 200 yards on the ground dont let the sack stats fool you at least 23 of those were because josh mccown held the ball too long and dont forget brent qvale was subbing for brandon shell credit to steve marshall oline coach for having the backups ready to play
 david bass with another excellent game as he continued to bring edge pressure he had a sack a tfl and did a good job setting the edge in the run game lorenzo mauldin needs to take note as he recovers on ir
 kony ealy with a huge impact game as he had 4 pass blocks and an int that set up a fg
 leonard williams with a nice game clogging up the run lanes and breaking down jax oline schemes multiple times
 josh mccown ended up with good game manager stats but he has to show better decision making he held the ball too long on a number of occasions which led to sacks and to me the scoop score that made it 2017 was his fault because he rushed the pass to powell after the 40 yard bomb to robby anderson there was no need to rush the next play be conservative and run the clock there was no way blake bortles was going to generate two scores in the 4th quarter
 lachlan edwards with a rollercoaster ride of a game the lows were the short punt in ot that put jax on the edge of fg range and not being aware at the end of the first half that he needed to be on the field for the fg attempt which led to a delay of game penalty edwards was celebrating one of his highs the fake punt pass as the clock was ticking down the other high was the 70 yard punt which pinned jax back inside the 5 yard line
 props to chandler catanzaro for the game winning fg but you cant miss the kick at the end of the first half
 good follow up game by demario davis as he continued to be physical and laid some serious licks on chris ivory leonard fournette
 the selfinflicted wounds have to be eliminated because this team isnt good enough to overcome them on a regular basis penalties in fg range holding the ball too long for sacks and not being aware that youre needed on the field cant happen
 robby anderson was relatively quiet because of the excellent play by aj bouye jalen ramsey but his speed is ridiculous because on the 40 yard bomb he torched bouye with a simple stutter move
 blake bortles stinks and his coaching staff knows it they play around him hoping he doesnt screw up the game
 the jets should send marquise lee a game ball as he had a huge drop in ot and he then mishandled edwards punt which put them inside the 10 yard line
you can read more about these thoughts and see what jets fans are saying in our new york jets message board
you can discuss this with other ny jets fans on the jet nation message board or visit of on facebook

"__label__fake by catherine j frompovich
the international agency for research on cancer iarc of the world health organization generated some information in 2014 subsequently republished online by the us national institutes of health which was titled disclosures of interestsprimary endpoints for prophylactic hpv vaccine trials
several entries sort of stand out for various reasons
dr douglas lowy reports that as part of his united states governmentsupported research at the national cancer institute ncinational institutes of health nih he is an inventor of technology that underlies the l1based prophylactic viruslike particle vlp hpv vaccine and technology that underlies an l2based candidate prophylactic hpv vaccine the nih has licensed the technology for the l1 vlp vaccine to merck the manufacturer of gardasil to glaxosmithkline the manufacturer of cervarix and to indian immunologicals ltd the l2based vaccine technology is the subject of a cooperative research and development agreement between the nci johns hopkins university and shantha biotech and has been licensed to shantha panvax acambis inc and glaxosmithkline united states federal law entitles dr lowy to a limited share of royalties the nih receives for these technologies dr joel palefsky reports that his research unit at the university of california san francisco benefited from research funding from merck and hologic dr palefsky reports that he benefited from support for travel from merck dr palefsky reports that he has received honoraria for a research presentation at qiagen dr palefsky reports that he testified on behalf of merck on the vaccine efficacy in males dr john schiller reports that as part of his united states governmentsupported research at the national cancer institute ncinational institutes of health nih he is an inventor of technology that underlies the l1based prophylactic viruslike particle vlp hpv vaccine and technology that underlies an l2based candidate prophylactic hpv vaccine the nih has licensed the technology for the l1 vlp vaccine to merck the manufacturer of gardasil to glaxosmithkline the manufacturer of cervarix and to indian immunologicals ltd the l2based vaccine technology is the subject of a cooperative research and development agreement between the nci johns hopkins university and shantha biotech and has been licensed to shantha panvax acambis inc and glaxosmithkline united states federal law entitles dr schiller to a limited share of royalties the nih receives for these technologies dr margaret stanley reports that she received personal consultancy fees from sanofi pasteur msd glaxosmithkline and msd dr stanley reports that she received personal speakers fees from msd
one has to wonder just how much the above interests can and do influence either the science or propaganda generated by pharmaceutical companies in their zealous promotion of the very dangerous hpv vaccines being promoted for various health reasons when first they were promoted as preventing cervical cancer in young women now boys who dont have cervixes are mandated to receive them too
the australia connection
in australia there is a current war of words going on regarding all mandatory vaccines and in particular the hpv vaccine between citizens and the aussie governments no jab no pay mandatory vaccine policy with groups like no jab no pay no way stating
no way to pressuring or forcing injections that can cause serious medical conditions even death abusing its power from needy families dependence the government threatens to withhold needed funds to pressure or force 20 thousands of parents to allow their children to be directly injected and by its own admission after only very limited testing3 with all of 86 antigen doses 8 injections 74 antigen doses before 12 months of age and 2 more injections by 4 years of age4 plus foreign organism components neurotoxins and multiple chemicals such as aborted foetal animal cell line components dna aluminium polysorbate 805 genetically engineered yeast msg antibiotics and potentially animal viruses andor other contaminants6 source
the factual irony of the no jab no pay policy is that it truly is unconstitutional in principle as two countries now have stated mandatory and coercive vaccination policies which australias definitely is because government welfare benefits are attached are unconstitutional those countries are sweden in europe and colombia in south america
as the no jab no pay no way website clearly and legally asserts
no way to disregarding inalienable human rights individuals have inalienable rights to life bodily security equality and free exercise of thought conscience and religion provisions for these rights are not loopholes they are expressed in the constitution common and statute law and international human rights instruments 19 accordingly the high court 1949 has ruled that any form or extent of compulsion of medical services whether legal by penalties or by any other means direct or indirect could not be authorized 20 so whatever law the government enacts vaccination will remain illegal unless parents give valid consent the government itself instructs that consent to vaccination is valid only if given voluntarily in the absence of undue pressure coercion or manipulation and after the potential risks and benefits of the vaccine risks of not having it and any alternative options have been explained 21 otherwise vaccination may constitute battery negligence malpractice professional misconduct andor fraud by the administrator cjf emphasis source
however australian health officials and all healthcare consumers there need to factor into the no jab no pay brouhaha going on somethings that probably can influence changing the disregard for denying inalienable human rights vested corporate interests and marketing plans on the part of vaccine manufacturers their subsidized scientists and public relations mouthpieces ie doctors pharma financially support and provide gratuities to in australia one such individual according to the iarc list is
dr suzanne garland reports that her unit at the royal womens hospital benefited from research funding from csl merck and glaxosmithkline dr garland reports benefiting from personal speakers fees and support for travel from csl merck sanofi pasteur and glaxosmithkline cjf emphasis
dont csl 1 merck and glaxosmithkline provide hpv vaccines in australia
is australia so hung up on pushing the hpv vaccines because it was australian research technology and csl has the exclusive right to market in australia and new zealand any merck hpv vaccine developed using csls technology 1
heres csl australian pharma company role in the hpv vaccine
csl chief scientific officer andrew cuthbertson said merck expected to apply for a licence for the hpv vaccine in the second half of 2005 following extensive phase iii trials were very excited about this project not just because we believe it is commercially important for csl i think from an australian science point of view this is terribly important dr cuthbertson said csl had not released any information in relation to milestone payments linked to the hpv vaccine or to potential royalties from sales the vaccine could be on the market about 12 months after gaining regulatory approval dr cuthbertson said merck expected to be the first to sell the vaccine under the trademark gardasil in the major markets of the united states and the european union the initial target group would be women aged 19 to 24 of which there were 60 to 70 million in the us and europe merck was carrying out studies on vaccinating women aged 25 to 45 which comprised about 100 million women in the us and europe dr cuthbertson said 1
now lets juxtapose the article ten years on professor ian frazer recalls lucky discovery of cervical cancer vaccine against the following devastating information about hpv vaccines adverse reactions from countries around the globe which australia and the usa both need to consider seriously and at least make hpv vaccines not mandatory but voluntary voluntary status for those who either dont know the real science behind the hpv vaccines or those who think hpv vaccines may be helpful truly is the constitutional way to go as opposed to the totalitarian way now being forced on adolescents and their parents

are prospective hpv vaccinees andor their parentsguardians given andor told as part of informed consent and medical ethics the above fulldisclosure about the risksbenefits of hpv vaccines before inoculation
no why not shouldnt that be legally mandated with vaccinees signatures giving consent required as part of vaccination protocols anywhere in the world starting with australia and the usa
another medicallegal protocol which must be instituted and enforced is this when anyone under 21 years of age dies a complete record of their vaccinations with dates administered must become part of the autopsy report and medical review before issuance of a death certificate

in january of 2016 the american college of pediatricians issued the report new concerns about the human papillomavirus vaccine httpwwwacpedsorgwordpresswpcontentuploads12616newconcernsaboutthehpvvaccinepdf which i encourage everyone to study
free stormproof waterproof survival match kit ad nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed 1 longterm ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies34 or in the human vaccine trials 2 most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between hpv4 and pof premature ovarian failure and may not consider reporting pof cases or prolonged amenorrhea missing menstrual periods to the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers 3 potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component polysorbate 802 and 4 since licensure of gardasil in 2006 there have been about 213 vaers reports per the publicly available cdc wonder vaers database involving amenorrhea pof or premature menopause 88 of which have been associated with gardasil5 the twostrain hpv2 cervarix tm was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 47 of vaers amenorrhea reports since 2006 and 85 of those reports from february 2010 through may 2015 this compares to the prehpv vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of pof or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to vaers
dr sin hang lee md director of the milford molecular diagnostics laboratory milford connecticut wrote a 16page openletterofcomplaint to dr margaret chan directorgeneral of the world health organization regarding misleading safety information about the two hpv vaccines gardasil and cervarix another important document to study
dr diane harper md one of the original researchers on the hpv vaccine spoke out and
agrees with merck and the cdc that gardasil is safe for most girls and women but she says the side effects reported so far call for more complete disclosure to patients she says they should be told that protection from the vaccination might not last long enough to provide a cancer protection benefit and that its risks small but real could occur more often than the cervical cancer itself would parents and women must know that deaths occurred not all deaths that have been reported were represented in dr slades work onethird of the death reports were unavailable to the cdc leaving the parents of the deceased teenagers in despair that the cdc is ignoring the very rare but real occurrences that need not have happened if parents were given information stating that there are real but small risks of death surrounding the administration of gardasil she also worries that mercks aggressive marketing of the vaccine may have given women a false sense of security 2 cjf emphasis
all the above about the hpv vaccines would lead any thinking person to wonder why such a piginapoke is being mandated and forced on to adolescent children and their parents for compliance
is it a question of follow the money

"__label__real a major flaw has been detected in the newlyunveiled google home mini speaker that allows it to secretly record conversations without users knowing
last week google showed off its nextgeneration smart speakers at an event in san francisco following the event it sent members of the press home with a review unit of the google home mini expected to launch on october 19
android police tech blogger and founder artem russakovskii was the first to discover a bug in the software used by those devices after using the gadget he went to his google goog activity account page and noticed it was populated with audio clips recorded in his home
the google home mini saved recordings at times when the wake word ok google wasnt used a wake word typically triggers smart devices like google home and the amazon echo to start listening to your verbal commands
its not uncommon for companies like google and amazon amzn tech30 to keep the audio smart speakers hear but in this case the device wasnt activated by the wake word
my google home mini was inadvertently spying on me 247 due to a hardware flaw he wrote on the site
a google spokesperson confirmed the issue to cnn tech and said it stems from the touchpad known as the activation button on the devices given to early reviewers
unable to fix the glitch with the touchpad google has sent out a software update which will now permanently disable it this means users will only be able to activate the device with voice commands the volume and onoff buttons on the side of the device will continue to work
related google unveils new pixel phones speakers futuristic headphones
we take user privacy and product quality concerns very seriously although we only received a few reports of this issue we want people to have complete peace of mind while using google home mini the google spokesperson said
because the google home mini 49 doesnt officially launch until next week no paying customers have been impacted
meanwhile it appears the new largersized google home max smart speaker 399 doesnt have the bug
but the issue draws attention to the privacy concerns over alwayson devices that listen for wake words
the federal trade commission and department of justice should investigate this incident as well as the general use of alwayson devices marc rotenberg the president of the electronic privacy information center epic told cnn tech
epic has pending complaints with the ftc and doj alleging that alwayson devices like google home echo and siri violate consumer protection law and federal wiretap law
in the meantime google allows users to deactivate any existing google devices from saving audio recordings via its settings page"

britain is headed for the european union with no idea of what comes next theresa may the prime minister calls a snap election to ask the nation who should govern and is promptly told not you
when she comes to the un general assembly the annual jamboree for world leaders she is relegated to the second day of speeches and finds herself addressing a nearly empty hall 24 hours after donald trump and emmanuel macron have had their moment in the spotlight
although given the calamitous turn of events at the conservative party conference in manchester wednesday we should probably be grateful that no one was there to see her speak at the united nations
prime minister may delivered not so much a speech as a painful metaphor for the state of britain and the state of her leadership
with her party in turmoil after she frittered away the tory majority in parliament it was a chance to head off rivals such as boris johnson her foreign secretary who smell blood and are circling like sharks
but after today its not sharks anymore now the vultures are hovering
theresa mays problem is that the events fit with the dominant narrative of her as a failing prime minister stumbling on in power from one calamity to the next
let me take a moment to set the scene the party leaders speech is one of the big set pieces of the year for the prime minister it is right up there with the queens speech when the government sets out its legislative agenda the address is so important that a mere commoner cannot be entrusted with it for good reason as it turns out
for may the conservative party conference speech wednesday was even more important it was a chance to set the tone as lawmakers return to parliament after their summer vacation if ever she needed to deliver a commanding performance this was the time
but her voice refused to play ball an insistent cough sabotaged her every effort resisting gulps of water and reducing her words to a feeble croak never mind the pain to her larynx this was painful on the ears
it got worse as she tried to build to a killer line about the united kingdom moving forward in the world its the conservative party that has a vision of an open global selfconfident britain she paused distracted as a lone figure approached the podium
boris asked me to give you he said trying to hand the prime minister a p45 the letter issued when an employee leaves their job
get it
may gamely carried on even as security guards hustled the man serial prankster simon brodkin who goes by the name lee nelson out of the hall but the damage was done
there will be a security investigation how did he get in how did he get so close to the prime minister
but thats not the problem the problem is that what might have been passed off as a bit of knockabout fun by a david cameron or a tony blair now looks like a defining moment for this prime minister
were not laughing with her but at her
worse still her set disintegrated before she had finished two letters fell from the sign touting the conference slogan of building a country that works for everyone which ended up reading building a country that works or everyon
of course it wasnt her fault that she picked up a cough was targeted by a notorious prankster and the set fell down many of us grapple with fear of public speaking and mays struggles must now look like some of those nightmares come to life
meanwhile there are other leaders around the world who face bigger crises at home and abroad yet seem to sail blithely on

mexico citys numerous building collapses were a stark reminder of whats to come in california every 2025 years los angeles has been hit by a major earthquake says schlaich it has been 23 years since the 67 magnitude northridge earthquake hit the city in 1994 statistically its coming
reducing the number of buildings that might collapse

in a 2008 study the us geological survey found theres a greater than 99 chance of a 67 magnitude quake or larger hitting the california area over the next 30 years that type of quake along the san andreas fault in southern california could kill an estimated 1800 people the study said injure 53000 and result in 214 billion in damage californias infrastructure could be crippled for weeks if not months
in a stark recognition of those numbers in october 2015 los angeles enacted the nations most sweeping seismic regulations requiring about 14000 buildings to be retrofitted so they will withstand violent shaking
the apartment building alpha structural is retrofitting is one of those cityidentified vulnerable buildings schlaich points to a new steel column next to a clearly smaller older column the steel column goes 5 feet into the ground plus 2 feet of additional concrete below it this column keeps the people alive so the building wont collapse explains schaich the only problem with the retrofitting in los angeles say seismologists is the expensive process is happening too slowly expected to be complete in 2022
buildings were damaged after a 71 earthquake hit the in san francisco area on october 17 1989
in san francisco a similar city law for retrofitting softstory buildings was enacted in 2013 rolling out in four phases san francisco has seen compliance at near 99 for phase one and two and above 85 for phase three says bill strawn spokesman for san franciscos department of building inspection the fourth and last phase of retrofitting the citys softstory buildings wraps in september 2018 strawn says once complete the building collapse rate substantially improves in san francisco we go from an estimated 1 in 4 collapse rate of these nonretrofitted buildings during a quake to 1 in 30 and thats with minimal retrofitting says strawn
the 2008 study estimating damage at 214 billion was based on the state of buildings at that time and efforts to retrofit buildings at the city level undoubtedly change the statewide damage estimates says geophysicist doug given who serves as the earthquake early warning coordinator for usgs
developing an early warning system
sections of freeway ramps collapsed during the northridge earthquake on january 18 1994
there is another tool that would save lives and reduce costs in an earthquake one that given calls a nobrainer
the earthquake early warning system as its called is the best available technology to give seconds at times minutes notice that an earthquake is coming
it would use seismometers buried underground to detect shaking crucial moments before its perceptible in all the areas that will experience the quake and sensors distributed across the west coast capture the data in real time
the most beneficial part of those 3060 seconds says caltech engineering and seismology professor tom heaton is simply the headsup children can get under desks or move to safer areas of the school surgery can stop trains can come to a halt
this system is to provide as much information as is possible so you can make the best decisions during the earthquake says heaton

in the mexico city quake the early alert system warned people up to 30 seconds in advance that an earthquake was about to hit allowing them to flee vulnerable buildings or move to safer areas
mexico put its robust warning system into place after nearly 5000 people died in the 1985 mexico city quake an early warning system has also been in place in japan for decades today cellphones and school alarms ring in unison when a quake is about to hit a hightech system installed after the kobe earthquake in 1995
but in the united states the early warning system is in development stalled due to federal funding constraints usgs says only 40 of the necessary sensors for the eew system are in the ground
hurdles stand in the way
we only have twothirds of the annual operating funds says given were trying to build a system with that limited funding stream and will never get to a fully functioning system at this rate
i cant help but think of mexico city people killed by buildings and falling debris we dont want to see the same situation here he says i fear we will regret we didnt do this when we had the chance
usgs and the caltech seismological laboratory started research on the eew in 2006 with a thin budget relying on federal funding and some private donations in 2012 they went live with a beta system and earlier this year rolled out a pilot program to train systems and some utilities
just watched why arent earthquake warnings better replay more videos must watch why arent earthquake warnings better 0138
this year underscoring the lack of national urgency for an eew the trump administration initially budgeted nothing toward the usgs eew system bipartisan demands by members of congress tentatively restored the usgs eew funding to 102 million for this year although congress has yet to vote on the budget the state of california last year also allocated 10 million to developing the eew system
but usgs says the eew system will cost roughly 38 million to build and 16 million a year for operation and maintenance
its frustrating says heaton if you look at other countries they got the will and message after big and important earthquakes wed like to do it before that happens
he points to the nations attention to other disasters and political priorities as one of the reasons for the slow rollout for the eew system as a result he says were not ready
heaton underscores what a 72 earthquake in southern california would mean youd see collapse of literally hundreds of older concrete frame buildings he says youd see the collapse of many tall steel buildings built before 1995 we might even see collapse of todays most modern tall buildings it could be a very bad scenario i honestly dont want to live to see that day
more than 100000 people even as many as 300000 could be displaced if a major earthquake were to hit los angeles estimates aram sahakian general manager for the los angeles emergency management department
as cities and states try to prepare for the big one seismologists and city officials also recommend being prepared at a personal level
a major disaster like a 72 earthquake will overwhelm our resources says sahakian you as a person your family and your neighborhood need to be prepared to get no response if you call 911 you need to be able to survive on your own for hours or days"

nairobi reuters kenyan police fired teargas and shots in the air on monday as hundreds of demonstrators marched through the capital nairobi to protest against proposed legal changes that would make it harder for the supreme court to annul an election
reuters television footage showed a sport utility vehicle ploughing into some of the protesters severely injuring three but it was not immediately clear who was responsible and the police made no immediate comment on the incident
kenya is due on oct 26 to repeat a presidential election after the supreme court nullified an aug 8 vote due to procedural irregularities president uhuru kenyatta who won the august election will face opposition leader raila odinga
uncertainty over the coming election has created turmoil in the east african nation which is a regional trade hub and staunch western ally
as the demonstrators marched toward the election board in nairobi a reuters journalist saw men in plain clothes near security forces fire shots in the air police on horseback set up blockades to prevent protesters from accessing some roads
police also used teargas in the western city of kisumu odingas stronghold to disperse protesters though another demonstration in the coastal city of mombasa passed peacefully
odingas opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the october vote unless the electoral board changes some personnel a stance he declined on monday to clarify in comments that suggested he was keeping his options open for now
this is a democratic society we live in if i choose not to participate in the prerigged election process it is my democratic right no court can order me to do so odinga said in comments broadcast on kenyan tv stations without elaborating further

the protesters want to warn ruling party lawmakers not to pass an amendment to the election law that would limit the circumstances in which the supreme court could void an election on procedural grounds opposition lawmaker james orengo said
if parliament passes the law tomorrow it will be like declaring war on the kenyan people he said

justin muturi speaker of the national assembly said the amendment could be debated when parliament reconvenes on tuesday if lawmakers were keen to push it forward
he said the key part of the proposed law stipulates that if a candidate boycotts an election whose date has already been set the remaining candidate would win the contest without formal polls being held
the government is keen to avoid a constitutional crisis if odinga pulls out at the last minute frustrating the courts order to hold elections within 60 days muturi said
we are trying to prevent a crisis should there be no elections he told reuters by phone
the governmentbacked kenya national commission on human rights said on monday in a report that at least 37 people had been killed in a police crackdown on protests that immediately followed the august vote the highest death toll given so far
the report attributed some deaths to police using live bullets and a few from police bludgeoning using clubs it named a 6monthold baby girl a 7yearold boy and an 8yearold girl as being among the victims

london reuters the man who helped expose russias massive doping regime says the international olympic committee ioc is still in denial over the performanceenhancing drug use and would rather sweep it under the carpet than take meaningful action
american bryan fogel director of the documentary film icarus told reuters that ioc president thomas bach had betrayed clean athletes the world over by his failure to act decisively and that the world antidoping agency wada was crippled by its mandate with no ability to take action
russia repeated its regular denials of fogels accusations that it orchestrated mass doping wada dismissed his comments about its powers and the ioc declined to comment
fogel had set out to make a film showing the impact of selfadministered performanceenhancing drugs on his amateur cycling efforts but during the research he was introduced to grigory rodchenkov the former head of russias antidoping program
fogel said that after a few conversations he realized he had stumbled across a story on an entirely different level as rodchenkov gave details on the depths and complexity of doping in his homeland
what he told me and showed me was jawdropping astonishing frightening and worrying fogel told reuters
his account first published in the new york times led to the establishment of canadian lawyer richard mclarens independent report for wada which backed up his account
rodchenkov fled russia and is now in hiding in the united states he said he was in fear of his life after two other senior former russian antidoping officials nikita kamayev and vyacheslav sinev died suddenly within weeks of each other in february 2016 last week a russian warrant was issued for rodchenkovs arrest
the story of rodchenkovs relationship with fogel and how in fear of his life he left his family and friends behind is documented in the film now available on netflix
it gives details of what it says is a massive government doping project alleging secret service involvement and describing an intricate program of sampleswapping and bottletampering at the 2014 sochi winter olympics
one scene shows wada officials olivier niggli beckie scott and christiane ayotte and the iocs athletes commission chair claudia bokel reacting with shock at rodchenkovs account including details of what drugs dozens of athletes had been taking
hugely frustrated
almost 18 months on however fogel is frustrated by what he considers to be a lack of meaningful action with his main ire directed at the iocs failure to ban russia completely from the 2016 rio olympics
i quickly learned that the ioc would like nothing more than to sweep this under the carpet even after richard mclarens report proved beyond a reasonable doubt that everything grigory had said was true and showed the scale of the fraud the ioc wasnt willing to acknowledge it fogel said
to fob the decision on banning russia off to the individual sports federations was a punch in the face to olympic values and to every clean athlete their the iocs goal was simply to find a way to make the problem go away
asked about the comments the ioc said mr fogel is currently trying to promote his film and therefore we would make no response
the olympics governing body has however previously tried to explain its role in the process emphasizing that mclarens report never had the authority to bring antidoping cases against individual athletes
the ioc is reanalyzing all 254 urine samples collected from russian athletes at sochi while the 63 retested blood samples collected from russian athletes there were all negative
bach said last month that he had not watched the icarus film
foden was full of praise for mclaren who worked closely with rodchenkov during the presentation of his evidence but said wadas structure and the fact that it is 50percent funded by the ioc left it powerless
essentially the ioc owns wada and they wada have no power all they can do is observe and report he said
in wada there are good people trying to do the right thing but you have an organization essentially hamstrung by its mandate they wada can find a million crimes but without the authority to act they are a crippled organization
mclarens mandate
fogel cited the fact that 95 of the 96 athletes named by mclaren had been cleared as evidence of wada and the iocs failings but wada director general niggli told reuters that view was a misunderstanding of the situation
it is important to keep in focus that mclarens mandate was finding out about the system he told reuters he gave us the names but he and we said from day one there probably wouldnt be enough evidence for an individual antidoping violation
at that stage his mandate was finished but to say nothing is happening is totally wrong
niggli also said wada had a new set of compliance standards and the sanctions process would soon be carried out by an independent body probably the court of arbitration for sport and no longer by national bodies or federations
i think that shows there is a will from both sides to do the right thing he said
fogel also had stinging criticism for the russian authorities
grigory took extraordinary risks and had to leave everything behind he said theyve seized his assets tried to take his daughters apartment that he had bought for her and they are trying to take his wifes property
this film is truly a window into how russia operates putting sport aside it shows what the country is prepared to do to guarantee its influence in a geopolitical situation
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reuters the russian government decisively rejected the accusations
we have said many times that the state was never involved and cannot be involved in any sports doping he said
we dont know why rodchenkov fears for his life but we do know that he is on the international wanted list for crimes that he purportedly committed in moscow
dmitry svishchev who serves on the russian parliaments sport and physical culture committee and is the president of the countrys curling federation said rodchenkov was the person who should be facing punishment
there were unfortunately many cases in which some athletes tried to achieve results dishonestly there are cases like these all over the world but its insanity to say that there was a state program he said this is all rodchenkovs fantasy

"__label__real european unions chief brexit negotiator michel barnier holds a joint news conference with britains secretary of state for exiting the european union david davis after the latest round of talks in brussels belgium october 12 2017 reutersfrancois lenoir
brussels reuters brexit talks are deadlocked over money the eus michel barnier said on thursday as he ruled out discussions on future trade being launched by eu leaders next week but spoke of possible progress by december
barnier and his british counterpart brexit secretary david davis told reporters there had been some progress this week on the other two issues around britains march 2019 withdrawal from the bloc on which the eu demands sufficient progress before it will agree to discuss a transition and future relationship
with concern mounting about the possibility they might run out of time for any deal davis renewed his call for eu leaders to give a green light to trade talks after they meet prime minister theresa may at a summit in brussels next thursday
barnier made clear however that despite new momentum from concessions given by may in a speech at florence last month british proposals on expatriate citizens rights and the irish border still failed the eu test while londons refusal to spell out a detailed cash offer was very worrying for business
may said then that the other 27 countries would not lose out financially from brexit in the current eu budget period to 2020 and that britain would honor commitments but barnier said london was failing to say exactly what it was ready to pay
regarding that question we are at an impasse which is very worrying for thousands of projects everywhere in europe and also worrying for those who contribute he said
nonetheless he offered hope i am still convinced that with political will decisive progress is within reach in the coming two months with david davis we will organize several negotiating meetings between now and the end of the year
with signs that nerves are fraying on both sides as less than 18month remains before the deadline some hardline brexit supporters want may to just walk out of talks both negotiators repeated that they were ready for any eventuality including a collapse but barnier warned no deal would be a very bad deal
may herself said there had been good progress and welcomed barniers talk of further progress over the coming weeks
residence rights
britains secretary of state for exiting the european union david davis and european unions chief brexit negotiator michel barnier arrive to address a joint news conference after the latest round of talks in brussels belgium october 12 2017 reutersfrancois lenoir
davis announced a streamlined new system for the 3 million eu citizens in britain to claim residence rights answering eu concerns and said he expected good further progress on other issues barnier repeated that brussels stills wants them to have recourse to eu judges to safeguard their rights and said there were still differences on rights for future family members
a british demand for its million or so citizens on the continent to have lifetime rights to move to any of the blocs 27 countries after brexit is held up by doubts among the member states barnier said those are rights to do with postbrexit decisions and should be dealt with in the next phase of talks
i make no secret of the fact that to provide certainty we must talk about the future davis said stressing his demand for trade talks i hope the leaders of the 27 will provide michel with the means to explore ways forward with us on that
slideshow 3 images
as we look to the october council next week i hope the member states will recognize the progress weve made and take a step forward in the spirit of the prime ministers florence speech
barnier was pressed to say in public whether he would ask eu leaders permission to make some preliminary exploration of what a transition after march 2019 would look like eu officials and diplomats say he has raised that issue with governments
he told the news conference that he would follow a mandate ruling out any discussion of the future before issues arising from britains past membership are settled and said it was important to respect the sequencing
diplomats have said that german and french envoys quashed a suggestion by barnier last week that he start looking transition issues on thursday german chancellor angela merkel whose scope to change policy is limited by ongoing coalition talks stressed berlin would negotiate to minimize damage to germany
with the talks poised at a delicate stage eu officials say it is unclear what leaders will tell may next week they all rule out a clear move to trade talks but many expect positive language to try to defuse british accusations of brussels intransigence and to help may stand up to her own party critics
officials see the early part of next year as a virtual deadline for agreeing to move on to discuss the future relationship failure to do so would raise the risk of there being no smooth transition and even of no deal at all

the rapper famously stormed the stage in 2015 after becks last record morning phase pipped beyonces selftitled one to best album adding later that beck needs to respect artistry
beck hansen to give him his full name is in an elite club of only two singing stars who have suffered at the hands of a kanye awards bash tantrum along with taylor swift at the 2009 mtv vmas but thats no reason why the three of them cant be friends or even work together in the future right
yeah i dont know maybe he jokes its the music business youre walking right into centre of the whole thing its a circus
we were laughing about it shed had dinner with kanye after the grammys thing happened and morning phase came on in the restaurant they were in and he stopped the conversation and said what is this this is good she was smiling and said this is morning phase

that was a great secret show on sunday despite you saying the band were all jetlagged at the start
thank you very much it was a great night the crowd helped us we couldnt have had a better crowd
youve announced another one for thursday night do you like keeping secrets and pulling surprises
we were originally just coming here to do some tv and radio but i insisted on playing we havent played here in over a year and it just doesnt feel like we can come here without playing a gig its like visiting your friends
how was the reaction to new stuff
i was surprised it was great they were singing the backing vocals one of the songs on the new record theres a part where there arent enough of us in the band to sing the backing vocals and the crowd just starting doing it it was beautiful
you covered gary numan and the clash at the gig plus you perform on the same bill as robert plant on the jools holland show do these classic british artists hold a special place in your heart
absolutely theyre so formative for myself the people in my band everyone i grew up with we were completely influenced by the 60s and 80s waves of british and irish musicians we even just toured with u2 so that influence is still there
tell us about touring with bono and the guys
it was a great experience the audiences couldnt be more warm it was interesting because there was a more elevated feeling of people being passionate about being there and wanting to engage with the music
the band and their crew are incredibly kind thoughtful warm and generous and the doors are open and they want to hang out and engage everyone is working hard and theres lots of commotion but its very calm and very friendly for such a huge machine it was striking how human and open and relaxed it was

youve had another musical legend mc hammer signing copies of your new album hes calling it a great party record
i think its great to have him christen the record were label mates now i met him last year at the celebration of the anniversary of capital records in hollywood it was actually an idea of a friend of mine at the label theres a scene in step brothers where he gets somebody to sign a samurai sword and hes like why did you get him to sign the samurai sword and he says its the only thing we had
how important is the whole packaging and promotion of the modern album to you
for better or worse im involved in the whole thing id love nothing more than to call someone up and say hey can you throw something together and make it great or ill just come by and maybe sing a little something im more of a handson artist in every way
i have a lot of talented people and musicians i get to work with like greg kurstin who wrote and produced the record with me hes now a storied producer he was touring with me maybe 15 years ago and weve been in bands together for years
i wanted to make a record in the spirit of the songwriting team the more i look back on it my favourite songs are from bands that had two great songwriters in them i was trying to create a version of that for myself
but were all like family and its been a thrill for me to watch greg gently take over the world
image copyright getty images image caption adele and colors cowriter greg kurstin who is gently taking over the world
the last album morning phase won the grammy how do you top that
well this record started before the last one came out we wrote the songs in 201314 so my idea at the time was to make a record that was very up and had a lot of light in it and positive feeling id been for many years making much more experimental abstract darker moodier music
i guess a lot has changed during that time particularly in america does this record reflect that
not really these songs were already set in stone long before the secretion of unfortunate events and tragedies its a truly tumultuous time but i dont think these songs reflect that at all this is just the record i wanted to make five years ago its not really a reaction to anything
is it a relief now that its finally coming out
more like a collapse like the finish line at the marathon i cant feel my legs but ive been juggling a lot of things weve been touring constantly ive been collaborating with the chemicals and flume and helping other people write i worked on the pink and lady gaga records all kinds of things like i did a charity thing with mccartney its been an amazing period of time where these opportunities are coming up so ive been trying to juggle it but keep my eye on the record
what are your feelings now looking back on that grammy awards night in 2015
it was such a mixture of shock and amazement for me the joy was watching all the people that ive worked with for so long all get to share in this victory the musicians who played with me all these years the engineers that ive spent 15000 hours with trying to find this unachievable sound
then externally there was this circus of media and the things that kanye was saying and beyonce fans who were angry and thats something that you dont ask for but its like what did you expect ha you know its the music business youre walking right into centre of the whole thing its a circus

along with taylor swift youre in an elite club of two people that kanye has interrupted at big awards nights will we ever see the two or all three of you working together did someone say supergroup
yeah i dont know maybe well see i actually performed with her she invited me out to one of her concerts and we did one of my songs we were laughing about it shed had dinner with kanye after the grammys thing happened and morning phase came on in the restaurant they were in and he stopped the conversation and said what is this this is good she was smiling and said this is morning phase so even when he went on that whole thing i didnt take it personal and he reached out after everyones entitled to their own opinion ultimately he had let me know that he liked the record
finally can i ask you about the recent tragic shootings at a music festival in las vegas are you conscious of this while on stage yourself or do you have to block those things out
its the last thing im thinking about on stage but when i hear about it its all im thinking about because thats my work environment as a musician you can put yourself there and its horrible any of these shootings whether at a concert or an airport its unfortunately the world we live in and you have to keep living and engaging
starting with later withjools
yeah weve done it several times and theres nothing like it the novelty of sharing a stage with all the other musicians its funny and also just a humbling appreciation of all the talent there

"__label__real image copyright afp image caption it is the second time rodrigo duterte has barred police from his controversial war on drugs
philippine president rodrigo duterte has demoted the countrys police from leading his drugs war amid growing criticism of the bloody crackdown
the countrys drugs enforcement agency will take charge of operations instead
police say they have killed over 3850 people in antidrugs operations since mr duterte took office last year
in january he also suspended police from the war on drugs calling them corrupt but reinstated them again shortly afterwards
that suspension came after a south korean businessman was kidnapped and killed by antidrug police
the woman who kills drug dealers for a living
mr duterte was elected last summer on a hardline platform promising to fight drugs crime and corruption
image copyright reuters image caption mr duterte faces growing opposition over his policies
his policy of endorsing extrajudicial killings in the war against drugs has drawn widespread international condemnation and also led to criticism within the country
in september thousands attended rallies criticising his war on drugs although thousands of others attended rival produterte rallies
changing mood music
analysis by the bbcs howard johnson in manila
what were seeing at the moment is an attempt by the government to restructure its war on drugs
a summer of bad headlines notably the killing of three teenagers by the philippine national police pnp force sparked street protests and condemnation from the catholic church
over the last month the killings of drug suspects have seemingly slowed down while the pnp has launched a community drug rehabilitation programme
the mood music is also changing the pnp said last week of the 6225 drugrelated deaths during its operations not one of them was an extrajudicial killing while the presidents longterm partner cielito honeylet avanceñahas said she believed he would never order the police to kill drug addicts
its all a far cry from the early days of president dutertes term in office when he said theres three million drug addicts id be happy to slaughter them
the most highprofile controversy this summer involved a boy killed in caloocan on 16 august
police said the 17year old ran from them and then opened fire so they shot him yet his parents denied he had any involvement in drugs
a witness said police tried to force a gun into his hand and cctv footage shows a boy said to be him being dragged away by police contradicting claims he ran
as a consequence the police said 1200 officers from the capital manila would be retrained and then assigned to other units
while mr duterte still enjoys widespread support a fresh poll this weekend showed trust and satisfaction in the president drop to the lowest levels since the start of his term
on thursday relatives of two people killed by police filed a case in the countrys supreme court calling for the drug war to be declared illegal"

harrisburg pawashington reuters president donald trump on wednesday told workers that they would win under his tax plan saying it would help the middle class and boost the economy though critics say it would mainly benefit corporations and the rich
speaking in an airplane hangar at a pennsylvania air national guard base in harrisburg with a trailer truck behind him trump reiterated the basic points of the ninepage tax cut framework he unveiled two weeks ago
its a middleclass bill thats what were thinking of thats what i want trump said
ive had rich friends of mine come up to me and say donald youre doing this tax plan we dont want anything dont give it to us give it to the middle class and thats what were trying so hard to do he said
his remarks came as new reutersipsos polling showed that more than threequarters of americans say the wealthiest americans should pay more in taxes
the poll found 53 percent of adults strongly agree and 23 percent somewhat agree that the wealthiest americans should pay higher tax rates the sept 29oct 5 poll of 1504 people has a credibility interval a measure of accuracy of plus or minus 6 percentage points
financial markets have rallied strongly since trumps november 2016 election victory driven partly by expectations that he would cut taxes for businesses although policy analysts have been skeptical that he would do so
trump on wednesday boasted about the rally in markets
the stock market is soaring to record levels boosting pensions and retirement accounts for hardworking americans their values are going up every single day he said
earlier on wednesday san francisco federal reserve bank president john williams said he was a little bit discouraged about the prospects for federal tax reform
given the difficulties congress has had in passing laws this year williams in comments following a speech in salt lake city said he is losing confidence that any tax reform will be passed in the next six months or so
democrats dispute pay raise
trump said his plan for cutting corporate taxes could boost wage growth and mean a 4000 pay raise for the average household citing research from a white house economic council
democrats who oppose trumps plan dispute such claims
i have not seen any evidence that even comes remotely close to that richard neal the top democrat on the house of representatives ways and means committee said of the 4000 calculation at a forum on wednesday in washington
independent analysts have said trumps blueprint would provide uneven tax relief add significantly to the federal budget deficit and in some cases benefit the very wealthy
for instance taxpayers in the highest 1 percent of incomes making more than 730000 annually would get about half of the total benefit from trumps plan with aftertax incomes rising an average of 85 percent according to the tax policy center a washingtonbased nonprofit tax think tank
trump on wednesday said his framework would provide a 500 tax credit to those who care for an adult dependent or elderly loved one and that it would substantially increase the child tax credit no details on those items have been made public
congressional tax writers in the house and senate are working to fill in the details of trumps framework republican leaders hope to pass a bill by january delivering what would be trumps first legislative victory a year into his presidency
before that can happen the senate and house must open a procedural path for tax legislation by passing a budget resolution lawmakers have hoped to do that this month
corporate passthrough cuts
the tax framework developed in secret by a select group of senior republicans known as the big six calls for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and creating a new category for passthrough income earned by partners and sole proprietors which would be taxed at 25 percent instead of the 396 percent top individual rate currently paid by some
it proposes cutting the top individual rate to 35 percent but congressional tax writers may opt to create an additional higher rate for the highest earners
the plan also proposes eliminating the 40 percent tax on inherited estate assets worth more than 55 million or 11 million for a married couple
a highly placed republican operative who used to work with senior leadership on capitol hill said he did not expect the estate tax repeal to be included in a final package because the proposal would greatly benefit trump himself and his family which would leave the tax reform effort and trump open to democratic attack
he said many republicans do not see estate tax repeal as crucial but republicans have promised wealthy supporters for years that the tax which they call the death tax will end
trump on wednesday offered a different view republicans will end the crushing horrible and unfair estate tax he said

"__label__real mr trump who hosted the apprentice on nbc for 14 seasons dismissed mr corker on tuesday by mocking his height and suggesting he had somehow been conned the failing nytimes set liddle bob corker up by recording his conversation mr trump wrote was made to sound a fool and thats what i am dealing with
in labeling mr corker liddle the president was evidently returning to a theme he considered mr corker for secretary of state during the transition after last years election but was reported to have told associates that mr corker at 5foot7 was too short to be the nations top diplomat instead mr trump picked rex w tillerson who is several inches taller but whose own relationship with the president has deteriorated to the point that he was said to have called mr trump a moron
mr tillerson initially did not deny it but later he had a spokeswoman insist that he did not say it mr trump chose to believe the denial or at least said he did but in an interview published tuesday he insisted that even if it was true he could prove that he was actually smarter than his secretary of state
i think its fake news mr trump told forbes magazine but if he did that i guess well have to compare iq tests and i can tell you who is going to win
mr trump later denied that he had demeaned his secretary of state i didnt undercut anybody i dont believe in undercutting people he told reporters in a comment that must have amused the many people he has undercut since taking office asked if he still had confidence in mr tillerson mr trump said simply yes
at the time mr trump was sitting next to henry kissinger the former secretary of state who happened to be visiting the oval office on tuesday to be sure mr kissinger would hardly tower over mr corker on the basketball court but mr trump perhaps wisely did not risk challenging the former diplomat to an iq contest
photo
after the meeting with mr kissinger the president headed to a lunch with mr tillerson who was joined by a mediator defense secretary jim mattis sarah huckabee sanders the white house press secretary said they had a great visit and denied that mr trump was serious about the iq test he made a joke nothing more than that she said

mr trump was not joking when he took a shot earlier in the day at jemele hill the espn host who has called him a white supremacist and was suspended on monday for suggesting a boycott of the dallas cowboys advertisers if the team punished players who protested racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem
with jemele hill at the mike it is no wonder espn ratings have tanked in fact tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry mr trump wrote on twitter

he made no mention of the other dustup in his household in an interview aired on monday to promote her new memoir ivana trump his first wife told abc news that im basically first trump wife ok im first lady ok
that did not sit well with melania trump his third wife and the actual first lady who issued a retort through a spokeswoman dismissing what she called attentionseeking and selfserving noise
andy cohen the creator of the real housewives reality television show franchise found that too rich this is actually happening he wrote on twitter all the wives are fighting even i am speechless
mr trumps gibe at mr corker echoed his name calling during the presidential campaign when he labeled senator marco rubio of florida little marco senator ted cruz of texas lyin ted and hillary clinton crooked hillary he has used belittling nicknames to diminish political foes since taking office as well think cryin chuck schumer psycho joe scarborough and little rocket man kim jongun but has generally avoided doing so with powerful republican committee chairmen who control appointments and legislation
it was not clear what mr trump meant when he said the times set up mr corker by recording him angry that mr corker had suggested he was an agent of chaos mr trump lashed out at the senator on sunday by saying he didnt have the guts to run for another term a times reporter then interviewed mr corker by telephone and recorded the call with the senators knowledge and consent mr corkers staff also recorded the call and he said he wanted the times to do the same
i know theyre recording it and i hope you are too mr corker told the reporter
during the interview mr corker said mr trumps advisers were struggling to keep the president under control i know for a fact that every single day at the white house its a situation of trying to contain him he said he also said mr trumps reckless statements could put the country on a path towards world war iii
mr trump on tuesday rejected the suggestion that he was risking a nuclear war we were on the wrong path before he said presumably referring to north korea all you have to do is take a look if you look over the last 25 years through numerous administrations we were on a path to a very big problem a problem like this world has never seen were on the right path right now believe me
but what a path ms ouellette who has written or edited several books on reality television including better living through reality tv said mr trump the president had gone even further than mr trump the reality show star ever did

fool me once shame on you
thats the mantra going forward with this seminoles squad going 02 to start the season is i imagine not what seminole nation was anticipating heck i imagine most of college football wasnt anticipating this despite 2017 being a circumstantial season for the noles to say the least the loss against nc state was simply inexcusable despite breaking in a true freshman in qb james blackman qb play wasnt the reason why fsu lost the game the penalties against florida state despite what some fans may think isnt the reason why we lost the game fsus defensive performance the squad that was to be key to seminole victory at least early on in the season was perhaps the critical component as to why fsu lost this home opener the fact that nc state came prepared and firedup shouldnt come as a surprise but the lackluster motivationurgency on defense falls squarely on both the players as well as the coaching despite some rust two weeks of preparation and no games in between should of been plenty to prepare against a veteran and hungry wolfpack
ranting over fsu is just one loss in the acc fsu has the talent to beat every team on their schedule yes this includes a surging clemson squad but they have two strikes one loss anticipated the other not so coaching must improve to salvage the season but it should come as no surprise that fsu can still make the acc championship game alabama doesnt count against them in conference and nc state has a tough slate ahead of them a loss is entirely possible for the pack in acc play that being said fsu must play errorfree in conference to do so
at this time i do not have faith in this squad to do so most analysts that i trust that follow florida state have them at best a 83 squad remember the game against ul monroe was cancelled meaning this is an 11 game season this likely means a loss to clemson at clemson sc i personally am leaning towards fsu being somewhere between a 74 and on my worst of days even a 65 squad
ive said it before and ill say it again as an alumnus i am proud to call myself a seminole and am proud of this team regardless but there is no doubting jimbo has a staffing problem that needs rectifying fast the message is being lost on the players and thisll impact recruiting if jimbo doesnt jump ahead of this at the end of the season and make some maneuvers with his staff
that all being said fsu and jimbo can prove us all wrong with a statement win against wake forest at wake forest
wake forest 40 on the season so far
wins against presbyterian 517 boston college 3410 utah state 4610 app state 2019
strengths qb play defensive line dave clawson coaching
weaknesses talent vs fsu
the line fsu 75
comments fsu needs a desperate win and a big one for me to make any reconsideration on the outlook of the season i think dave clawson is going to have the deacons prepared to defend their home turf against the struggling seminoles fool me once shame on you im giving fsu one last chance here i think the talent that fsu has on the field despite the preparations made by wake forest will be overwhelming for the deacons those four wins came against teams that wake forest should of beat fsus losses are given circumstances entirely understandable although not quite excusable a loss here would be catastrophic for fsu both for the season and beyond i dont see it happening with so much on the line wake forest plays fsu close and might even lead early on but i think fsu breaks away by the second half i think fsu covers the spread 2714 fsu better cover the spread for the nation to have reconsidered outlooks on the program in conference let alone in the national landscape wake forest in recent history has played fsu close i imagine it will be the same in this edition if wake forest breaks the line or forbid me to say it beat fsu you can bet that ill lean my outlook on the season towards the 65 range and at risk for a bowl berth

explaining the rationale for partial pass rush charges
many folks who read this column regularly are also familiar with pffs grading for offensive line play a full differentiation of methodology would be too much for this piece but i want to take a moment this week to underscore a major difference between my scoring system and theirs
pff scores all pass rush events as 1 or 0 for any given player so on any given play a player either allowed a sack or they didnt occasionally pff will charge 2 sacks on the same play if for example both tackles are beaten by their respective opponents independently
the rationale for the occasional double charge is that neither player should be bailed out by the poor performance of another that makes a lot of sense and i prefer pffs methodology for a very limited subset of pass rush events involving independent breakdowns
however many more sacks are due to a combination of smaller circumstances blown stunt pickup compression of the pocket a block that crosses the pocket qb holds the ball too long or leaves a clean pocket etc a good example happened in sundays game on the sack split by jackson and campbell q1 251 to summarize the play
 ronnie stanley failed to pick up a reasonably clean stunt handoff from james hurst allowing calais campbell to penetrate through the left b gap
 austin howard stepped outside just a little too far which left a gaping right b gap for dante fowler made more substantial by the fact malik jackson initially engaged rg jermaine eluemunor slightly to the inside of where he lined up fowler moved through quickly and howard had to block him across flaccos face and through the pocket that distraction brought flaccos eyes off the receivers as he tied to find a clean spot
 eluemunor initially engaged jackson but allowed him to bounce off to the outside where howard had turned his back to chase fowler jackson and campbell arrived simultaneously to deliver a punishing sack
my understanding is that eluemunor received a full sack charge on this play from pff and i assume stanley did as well but have not verified
if forced to charge 1 player with this sack i would have given it to howard since the pressure he allowed broke down the integrity of the pocket first however since i dont have a definitional constraint on dividing charges i gave 13 sack to each of howard stanley and eluemunor if anything i was a little harsh on jermaine and easy on howard as i watched the play a number of times the question was whether the appropriate charge for eluemunor was 2 13 sack or 0 missed block with no share of the sack not 2 or 3 half sack shared with either stanley or howard
i encourage you to watch the play for yourself and leave a comment as to how you would allocate a single sack in that situation including any of the offensive linemen or flacco himself
divisible shares of sacks come with their own problems but i believe the pros outweigh the cons
pros
 total sacks charged match total sacks
 it allows for allocation of blame in complex situations
 contributing elements of sacks such as pocket compression which might normally have no charge are more properly assigned
 allocation errors are far smaller than 1 or 0 methods using only 1 or 0 is similar to going to a store to buy toothpaste or a gallon of milk when all charges have to be rounded to the nearest 100 because thats the only currency available many individual transactions would have a big error
cons
 its more complex and adds a 2nd layer of subjectivity to assign shares
 occasionally a player will receive a smaller share due to multiple independent breakdowns across the line
offensive line scoring
the ravens ran 54 scored snaps versus the jaguars excludes accepted penalties which result in no play
stanley ronnie had his worst game since the 4penalty meltdown in week 9 of last season vs the steelers in addition to an illegal use of hands flag and the share of the sack described above former terp yannick ngakoue beat stanley for 35 pressures q2 306 half and q3 942 and q3 451 and q4 949 he had 3 blocks in level 2 1 pancake and 1 highlight combination block on the first ravens offensive snap
scoring 54 plays 44 blocks 4 missed 075 penetrations 35 pressures 13 sack 1 illegal use of hands 275 points 51 per play with adjustment thats still a high f
hurst james also had his worst game since 2015 he was also beaten for 35 pressures beaten outside by ngakoue beaten inside by stunting jackson beaten outside by telvin smith and beaten inside by ngakoue on failed stunt pickup hurst missed 6 blocks 4 of which were a result of being beaten and 1 other which was a missed block in l2 on which he escaped a fairly obvious holding flag q4 833 he connected on 3 of 4 pulls but allowed a partial penetration on the 4th q1 327 he made 5 blocks in level 2 including a highlight combination on jackson then jack in level 2
scoring 54 plays 42 blocks 6 missed 125 penetrations 35 pressures 325 points 60 per play after adjustment hes still 3 points shy of passing f
jensen ryan had his best game as a professional by a wide margin his improvement the last 2 weeks gives hope he can be the center the ravens have lacked since birk however there is still a gremlin lurking which popped up on one of his best blocks of the day q3 528 on that play ryan engaged jags ilb telvin smith in level 2 drove him 5 yards pancaked him then crawled further on top of him as smith attempted to get up jensen performed a superman lifting his arms and legs off the ground to leave his full weight on smith the officials quickly broke it up and had words with jensen as i hope the ravens coaches have as well he had 5 blocks in level 2 delivered 3 pancakes and had 3 highlights the best of those was a 1gap pull to a level 2 cut block that flattened posluszny q4 833
scoring 54 plays 50 blocks 4 missed 50 points 93 per play after adjustment thats a high a at center
skuraeluemunor matt skura was elevated from the practice squad to be the unlikely starter after bergstrom imploded in the 2nd half versus the browns he shared time 41 snaps with the jermaine eluemunor 13 snaps each had similar scores by different paths skura had obvious difficulty anchoring as he surrendered consecutive pressure events to bull rushes by dt day 12 qh q2 1016 and jackson pressure on the next snap matt connected on 3 of 4 pulls made 1 block in level 2 and did not record a highlight eluemunors only failure was the partial charge on the sack described above he pulled twice successfully but did not have a highlight
scoring for skura 41 plays 36 blocks 3 missed 1 pressure ½ qh 325 points 79 per play with adjustment thats a c at guard
scoring for eluemunor 13 plays 12 blocks 13 sack 10 points 77 per play thats too few snaps for a grade 20 is the minimum
scoringcombined 54 plays 48 blocks 3 missed 1 pressure ½ qh 13 sack 425 points 79 per play their play wasnt perfect by any means but their combined c was the only passing grade other than jensens
howard austins lack of quickness caught up with him in a game where he faced one of the leagues good young pass rushers dante fowler and allowed parts of 6 pass rush events in addition to a hold he was pancaked by ngakoue at the feet of flacco for pressure on ramseys interception q3 1033 he made 5 blocks in level 2 but did not have a highlight
scoring 54 plays 43 blocks 4 missed 3 pressures 083 qhs 13 sack 1 offensive holding 265 points 49 per play thats another f which is 06 short of passing after adjustment its some small consolation that none of the offensive linemen fell completely off the table with a score 30 or 40 short of passing
if youre interested in seeing scoring trends for the players this season these charts will be updated weekly
ill do a separate piece on joe flaccos performance when time allows he had ats on just 7 of 20 drop backs but it should come as no surprise that this was among the worst performances of his career relative to his opportunity set

in taking the legal reins at apple adams will take over a wideranging dispute with qualcomm over how that chipmaker licenses its technology to apple at the heart of the dispute is qualcomms longheld practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iphones and other apple devices as a licensing fee for its mobile connectivity patent portfolio
apple has sued qualcomm over that practice in us civil courts as well as 11 foreign jurisdictions qualcomm has brought an action against apple before the us international trade commission seeking to ban imports of some iphones qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action

but it can serve as a lesson for the world in protecting democracy and human rights writes viñolas
gloria p viñolas is an international journalist and a guest lecturer of journalism and international relations at ramon llull university her work has appeared in publications including el pais forbes and spanish media outlets
cnn the violence we witnessed following catalonias referendum vote this weekend was terrifying but it can and should be a lesson for the world about the importance of upholding the spirit of democracy and the protection of human rights
as one of 17 spanish autonomous communities or regional governments catalonia maintains limited authority on matters such as health and education however some of the larger economic and fiscal issues affecting infrastructure and security remain in the hands of the spanish government
gloria vinolas
though catalans have wanted to engage in a dialogue around the distribution of powers for some time now the spanish government has refused most recently spains constitutional court suspended catalonias referendum law holding that an independence vote would only be legal following an amendment of the spanish constitution an option that has no support from the ruling parties in madrid
of course that didnt stop sundays vote or the violence that ensued the spanish government which denies the legitimacy of the vote and the right of the catalan people to selfdetermination deemed the referendum illegal and deployed thousands of policemen in an effort to prevent the vote according to the catalan government almost 900 people were injured as police raided over 300 polling stations
given madrids likelihood to adopt coercive measures thus far and catalan president carles puigdemonts statement that he would declare independence in the coming days the conflict may very well escalate

"__label__real like many other advocacy groups the chamber is putting extra emphasis on how lawmakers vote on tax and economic issues and wont be inclined to throw its support behind those who dont share the views of the business lobby
the first big test for senate republicans and their twoseat majority comes next week when they will try to advance a budget that sets the parameters for a tax bill and establishes a procedural framework to approve it with a simple majority the house last week narrowly passed its version of a budget but not before 18 republicans defected
a tax overhaul would be nearly impossible to achieve if the budget fails and senate leaders dont have the kind of cushion that their house counterparts had senator rand paul republican of kentucky has already indicated that he could oppose the spending plan senator john mccain the arizona republican who has clashed with the president and helped kill the health care repeal is also considered a question mark
that means republicans cannot spare another vote
thats where the increasingly toxic relationship between mr trump and senator bob corker of tennessee comes into play mr corker is a senior republican member on the budget committee who had already expressed misgivings about the tax plan and the potential for higher federal deficits losing his vote could be fatal but mr corker has very close relationships in the senate and many republicans doubt he would kill the budget or tax plan simply to spite mr trump

defeating the budget is dishing more punishment on your colleagues than it is on the president said neil bradley senior vice president at the chamber and a former top republican official in the house
acutely aware of the tightrope he is walking senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader wrote an oped for nbc news encouraging democrats interested in cutting taxes to put aside their issues with the president and join republicans it is unlikely to have much effect on the usually partyline budget vote but republicans know their job would be much easier if they could peel off just one or two centrist democrats facing reelection next year
any significant rewrite of the tax code is extremely difficult a political truth underscored by the fact that the last major overhaul was in 1986 republicans concede that there are plenty of disagreements of the magnitude that could easily scuttle a proposal

but they argue that republicans are in such a politically perilous position because of their lack of accomplishment thus far that lawmakers and the white house are going to have to overlook their differences and come together on a plan otherwise theyll be staring into the abyss
members on both sides of the capitol are going to have to be flexible and swallow features that may give them political indigestion in order to get a bill said bob stevenson a republican strategist and former senior senate aide who was on capitol hill for the last tax overhaul but as ben franklin said you hang together or hang separately
mr bradley the chamber official said he agreed that in a more conventional political environment existing divisions among republicans could be sufficient to kill a tax bill but there is such a growing realization that failure is not an option that they will be able to overcome a lot of these policy and political conflicts he said
mr bradley notes that republicans might not be the only ones to take a hit if the taxcut push collapses he said the death knell for tax revisions would cause a worrisome domestic economic disruption as well
as they fret about the outlook for tax cuts republicans also understand that eventual success on a tax plan could ease a lot of the criticism they have come under for their legislative failures and demonstrate they have the capacity to run washington
this is not one that can get left on the cutting room floor said josh holmes a communications adviser with close ties to mr mcconnell it has become a barometer of whether republicans can govern under trumps leadership
at the moment thats still an open question but a republican failure to succeed on a tax bill would provide an irrefutable answer"
"__label__real washington reuters president donald trump said on tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow americans to buy strippeddown health insurance policies a step some experts say would further undermine the obamacare law that trump opposes
unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a congress led by his own party trump indicated he would take unilateral action he offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain great competitive healthcare costing the united states nothing
the expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some obamacare requirements these include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care prescription drugs and mental health treatment
it would also expand the amount of time people can use shortterm medical insurance plans which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits people could use those plans for up to a year compared to three months under current law
ill also be signing something probably this week which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare trump told reporters in the oval office
with congress the way it is i decided to take it upon myself trump added saying the plan is largely worked out
white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump will make his announcement by the end of friday
trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines the association health plans for instance could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under obamacare potentially making them attractive to people in other states
it is unclear when these plans would become available it is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period which begins nov 1
experts questioned trumps authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation the action could open trump to legal challenges from democratic state attorneys general who have said they will sue trump if he tries to destroy obamacare
us president donald trump meets with former us secretary of state henry kissinger in the oval office of the white house in washington us october 10 2017 reuterskevin lamarque
the plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 affordable care act dubbed obamacare that could further destabilize those markets where insurers have already exited the markets altogether pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the trump administration
experts said trumps plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the obamacare markets raising premiums and effectively eroding the laws protection that people with preexisting medical conditions cannot be charged more
hurt rather than help
theres a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets said craig garthwaite director of the healthcare program at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management referring to the trump administration
it unwinds the ability of people with preexisting conditions to get insurance under the aca garthwaite said
republicans have failed to make good on their sevenyear promise to repeal and replace obamacare the signature domestic policy achievement of trumps democratic predecessor barack obama gutting obamacare was a top trump campaign promise
trump who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it implode has undermined obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions
last week the us department of health and human services issued a rule that will let businesses and nonprofit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the laws mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no copayment
trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under obamacare the payments are estimated to be about 7 billion this year and help lower outofpocket medical costs for lowincome consumers insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums
his administration has slashed the obamacare advertising budget halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law"

while questions remain as to whether the federal bureau of investigation had prior knowledge of the las vegas shooting the victim of another terrorist attack on united states soil is speaking out and attempting to hold the fbi accountable for the suffering he endured
in may 2015 two men opened fire outside of a provocative draw muhammad event in garland texas while the suspects were ultimately the only casualties the attack is notable in that it became the first isisclaimed attack on american soil it is also notable because of the close proximity between an fbi agent and one of the suspectsboth before and during the attack
bruce joiner a security guard who was shot and wounded after elton simpson and nadir soofi opened fire outside of the event is now suing the fbi for 8 million he has filed a lawsuit claiming that fbi agents solicited encouraged directed and aided members of isis in planning and carrying out the may 3 attack
as the washington examiner noted if joiner does not reach a settlement with the bureau the case could shake loose hundreds of documents from both local and federal officials about what happened that day and could answer the question of why an fbi agent was in a car directly behind the attackers and did nothing as the events unfolded
simpson gained the fbis attention a few years before the attack as a muslim who they saw as vulnerable to radicalization in fact fbi agents were reportedly monitoring him in the weeks leading up to the attack and there was even an agent in a car following him to the scene who did nothing to prevent the crime
according to a report from cbs news court records revealed that the fbi agent who was in the car directly behind simpson and soofi during the attack had texted simpson just weeks before with the message tear up texas and he was even taking pictures of the car about 30 seconds before the first shots were fired as soon as the suspects opened fire the agent fled the scene
as the free thought project reported both local law enforcement and the fbi did not respond to warnings from a woman connected to anonymous who cautioned that there was going to be an isisinspired attack at the eventjust days before it happened
the fbi helped the terrorists obtain a weapon that was used in the attack by lifting a hold during a background check incited the terrorist to attack the garland event and even sent an agent to accompany the terrorists as they carried out the attack the lawsuit states according to a report from the washington examiner
the lawsuit also calls out former fbi director james comey claiming that he worked to cover up the bureaus prior knowledge of the threat posed by simpson
in the aftermath of the attack former fbi director james comey lied to the american people by claiming that simpson was a needle in a haystack that was invisible to us even after it had come to light that an undercover fbi agent had been communicating extensively with the terrorists during the week prior to the event and had accompanied them as they carried out the attack the fbi continued to assert that there was no advance knowledge of a plot to attack the cartoon drawing contest
the issues alleged in the lawsuit could be explosive if the fbi is forced to acknowledge and respond in addition to the accusation that the bureaus agents encouraged and directed the attack the claim that the agents lifted a hold during a background check in order to help simpson and soofi obtain the firearms used in the attack is incredibly important it is a reminder that even if gun control measures requiring strict background checks become law the fbi has the power to bypass them in order to serve their agenda
as wikileaks founder julian assange recently noted almost all terror plots are created by the fbi as part of its business model while his comments were in reference to the las vegas shooting the underlying principle applies to a number of both foiled and deadly attacks

in a previous report we pointed out that simply passing laws isnt enough ensuring government agencies comply with transparency requirements and limits on surveillance activities takes constant vigilance pressure and activism some organizations in california are doing just that
in an effort to better understand how police in los angeles use automatic license plate readers the aclu and the electronic frontier foundation demanded that the lapd and the los angeles sheriffs department lasd turn over records related to those agencies use of alpr technology including all alpr data collected or generated during a oneweek period in august 2012 consisting of at a minimum the license plate number date time and location information of each license plate recorded
the aclu and eff made their request under a california state law known as the california public records act as ucla law professor eugene volokh points out the law was written broadly to require government agencies to release a wide range of information and a special provision of the california constitution instructs courts to read it broadly
the lapd and lasd estimate they scan between 29 and 3 million license plates per week the police department stores license plate data include the plate number location and the date and time of the scan for 5 years the sheriffs department stores information for 2 years
unsurprisingly the law enforcement agencies denied the request relying on exceptions in the california public records act the lapd and lasd cited two exceptions in the public records law that exempts
1 records of police investigations and
2 records as to which on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record
the aclu and eff refused to take no for an answer and filed a lawsuit in state court to force release of the information
the court held the first exception doesnt apply at all finding that the scans are not conducted as part of a targeted inquiry into any particular crime or crimes but the court determined the second provision did preclude the release of raw alpr data ironically the judge said releasing information that includes actual license plate numbers would threaten individual privacy information pinpointing where a specific vehicle was at a specific time could potentially reveal where a person lives works or frequently visits
members of the public would be justifiably concerned about lapd or lasd releasing information regarding the specific locations of their vehicles on specific dates and times to anyone
given the grave threat to privacy one has to wonder why police can maintain databases filled with location information on thousands of people whose only crime was driving past an alpr camera
the courts decision was only a partial victory for the law enforcement agencies attempting to hide the scope of their alpr programs the court held that even though the lapd and lasd didnt have to release raw data they still might have to turn over the data in an anonymized form in order to withhold that information the agencies will have show its release would substantially interfere with law enforcement the superior court remanded to the trial court to gather more facts on whether there would be such interference
how much information the aclu and eff ultimately gets remains to be seen but had they not taken action and pushed the issue aggressively they wouldnt have gotten any information at all at worst they now have a california superior court judge on record asserting that alpr programs threaten basic privacy rights beyond that the organizations will likely get at least some information that will help them analyze the use of license plate readers in los angeles this will allow them to formulate better strategies to fight intrusive license plate tracking in the future theyve also generated significant public interest through their efforts
this reiterates an important truth laws like the california public records act are only tools a hammer doesnt do any good inside a tool box somebody has to get it out and swing it you cant just get a law passed and say well we fixed that
on the other hand we need good tools laws are important for whatever deficiencies the exceptions written into the law create the california public records act was a tool for action we need both tools and activists and organizations out there using them to hold government agencies accountable"

"__label__fake 5 stages of grief london cawing
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
sunday was a brutal day to be a ravens fan i wont even mention the score because it hurts too much to relive
luckily after nearly 48 hours of emotional whirlwind ive completed the 5 stages of grieving and im ready to move on if youre not quite there yet go through my firsthand journey below and perhaps well help you complete the cycle as well my friends
denial
first jags drive for a score okay thats not my ravens defense but maybe next drive again and again this is not happening right now the ravens first foray over the pond and they are going to not only shat the bed on offense but on defense as well the entire team is out of sorts clearly something isnt right because this is not the same ravens team we witnessed over the first few weeks
anger
fourth quarter and its a blow out im done with this game ill find absolutely anything else to do right now ill cut the grass
by hand
with scissors
thatll be more exciting maybe while im taking child safety scissors to the lawn i can listen to stephen hawking do his rendition of ave maria if i really want some entertainment because whatever the hell the ravens brought to london with them is anything but entertainment its literally the worst loss in ravens history turned international embarrassment this is the biggest britishbased flop since beyonce ruined the 3rd austin powers movie yea i know im harping on it but she was just so awful
and the coaches great job team dean pees adjusting on the fly is as likely as a regularseason ravens game without an injury to a starter joe flacco is more likely to not throw a pick than pees rush more than 3 at any critical point in the game i heard ben jerrys is making a dean peesflavored ice cream its basically just vanilla with some nuts thrown in
marty mohrninweg doesnt get off that easy either no ingame adjustments when you see the jags pinning their ears back honing in and getting instant pressure on flacco it was almost as if marty threw in the towel and accepted defeat assuming this game didnt count because its international
chumps all of them what a piss poor excuse of a game from play on the field to execution to coaching
bargaining
so many ways this pummeling over the pond could have been avoided
why couldnt the ravens brass just go out and get legit coordinators this offseason instead of defining insanity and hoping for improved results with the failures from 2016
why couldnt the coaching staff even make a smidge of an adjustment throughout the game
why couldnt the team have focused more efforts of the milliondollar question of why do all of our players get hurt at a higher rate than any other nfl team
and really look at those injuries what could have happened had this team been healthy instead of 17 players done for the season and thats outside of zach orrs retirement and dennis pittas 3rd hip injury
if only the team actually hadnt needed to play all of those backups perhaps the results would have been different
depression
lets be honest here the season is done
we beat two awful teams in the first two weeks then we lost to an average at best team in the jags can we just go ahead and say 2 more wins against cleveland and cincy again then yea that might be about it so 412 sound about right
but of course none of that will matter because just like this past offseason steve biscotti will clamp down on any chatter about firing coaches and instead will reup harbaugh then keep peesmarty on board claiming injuries were the only reason this team fell apart
rinse repeat
then theyll defer more contracts to sign more veteran players push more money into future years and when they finally decide to rebuild theyll have half of the cap allocated to guys who are no longer on the team
typical
acceptance
so heres the thing its one game and maybe just maybe that game was a fluke
i dont believe we are a true super bowl contender given the spattering of injuries and i think to assume the ravens are a playoff team is still borderline but i do believe if the ravens played the jags 9 more times there would never be another game nearly as bad as that one nor will the final score of the remaining 13 games on their schedule be that gross i believe sundays game on offense and defense was a true anomaly and if anything it pissed the ravens off
theyre angry
theyre not going to sit back and accept defeat
theyll come out of the gates hot against the steelers this week
at least i hope so
and honestly maybe this is exactly what the team needed an early season blowout
if they right the ship the team has plenty of time to redeem themselves
if they simply dont have the replacement level talent to maintain they have a poor season start from scratch in 2018 with a high draft pick and plenty of offensive talent ripe for the picking
if the coaches refuse to make adjustments marty and dean likely have pink slips waiting sooner rather than later while harbaughs seat gets hotter by the second possibly leading to the unemployment line
these are really the only options but ultimately how will we know until next week is played no sense in getting worked up just accept last weeks results and move on to steelers week

"__label__real rome reuters italys traditional political parties have pledged to back a new electoral law this week that is seen penalizing the antiestablishment 5star movement ahead of next years national election
the lower house of parliament is due to start voting on tuesday on an electoral law supported by the countrys main right and leftwing parties unlike the current system it would allow the formation of broad coalitions before a vote a factor likely to hurt 5star which refuses to join alliances
the only aim of the law is to allow others to gang up on us 5star lawmaker danilo toninelli said on sunday a day after a parliamentary committee signed off on the new proposal
for the traditional parties the important thing is to stop the 5star he said
a national vote is due to be held during the first half of 2018 between march and may
polls show matteo renzis ruling centerleft democratic party pd which proposed the new law is neckinneck with the 5star but if the pd runs in alliance with smaller centrist and leftwing parties together they would likely surpass the 5star now led by the 31yearold luigi di maio
the new law may be even more beneficial to silvio berlusconis centerright forza italia go italy party and the farright northern league which also back the bill in a coalition polls show they could win the most votes
the wind is blowing in the sails of the centerright and of forza italia the lowerhouse speaker of berlusconis party renato brunetta said
but polls give neither renzis centerleft or berlusconis centerright enough votes to govern alone suggesting a rightleft alliance may be the only way to form a government after the election
the bill could pass as early as this week in the chamber after which it would go to the senate for approval the risk is that it could be sunk by dozens of secret votes in which parliamentarians can break with the official party line
secret voting is what killed a previous election law proposal in june that initially had been supported by the 5star movement
the 5star catapulted into parliament in 2013 with nearly a quarter of the national vote but it has struggled to further expand its support it has vowed to rescue italy from the clutches of what it says is a corrupt political system
fivestars policies include the introduction of universal income support for the poor rewriting european union public spending limits and phasing out fossil fuels it now says holding a referendum whether to dump the euro which had been a pillar of its platform is not a priority
the proposed election law would distribute almost twothirds of the seats in parliament on a proportional basis while a third would be decided in a firstpastthepost vote on specific candidates
coalitions would need to get 10 percent of the national vote to get into parliament while parties running alone would need only 3 percent candidates would be chosen by party chiefs

"__label__real new york reuters the last privately owned leonardo da vinci painting and one of fewer than 20 by the renaissance artist known to still exist is hitting the auction block christies announced on tuesday
salvator mundi an ethereal portrait of jesus christ which dates to about 1500 is expected to sell for about 100 million at christies in november making it among the most highlyvalued works ever to be sold at auction
this is truly the holy grail of art rediscoveries said alan wintermute christies senior specialist for old master paintings explaining that the portrait sometimes called the male mona lisa had long been thought to have been lost or destroyed
the portrait depicts christ in vivid blue and crimson robes holding a crystal orb
first recorded in the private collection of king charles i the work was auctioned in 1763 before vanishing until 1900 by which time christs face and hair had been painted over which wintermute said was quite common practice
sold at sothebys to an american collector in 1958 for 45 pounds it again sold in 2005 as an overpainted copy of the masterwork he said

the new owner started the restoration process and after some six years of research it was authenticated as da vincis morethan 500yearold masterpiece which culminated in a highprofile exhibition at londons national gallery in 2011
the auction house did not identify the seller a european private collector who acquired the work after its rediscovery in 2005 and lengthy restoration the painting stands as the first discovery of a da vinci painting since 1909

salvator mundi will be sold at christies in new york at its nov 15 sale of postwar and contemporary art following public exhibitions in hong kong london and san francisco
we felt that offering this painting within that context is a testament to the enduring relevance of this picture said loic gouzer chairman of christies postwar and contemporary art
speaking to its 100 million estimate wintermute reflected there has never been anything like it sold and so the market will decide

"__label__real newark new jersey cnn prosecutors rested their federal corruption case against sen bob menendez wednesday capping off weeks of a trial that could determine the political future of the new jersey democrat
over 18 days of testimony from 35 witnesses prosecutors have tried to establish a quid pro quo bribery theory that they set forth during open arguments
this case is about a corrupt politician who sold his senate office for a life of luxury he couldnt afford said prosecutor peter koski and a greedy doctor who put that politician on his payroll for when he needed the services of a united states senator
menendez and his codefendant dr salomon melgen deny the charges and say prosecutors have wrongly twisted a 25year friendship into a federal crime
its a story of a lifetime of service done honorably hard work and sacrifice and a commitment to the people of new jersey and a longtime friendship with dr melgen menendez told reporters walking into court wednesday
menendez has not said he would resign if convicted and insisted his poll numbers will rise if hes acquitted
i have no intention of being anything but exonerated he told cnn last week so therefore im not contemplating anything but reelection next year
the heart of the justice departments case rests on accusations that menendez accepted political contributions free rides on private jets and a swanky hotel suite in paris from melgen in exchange for agreeing to pressure other highlevel federal officials in the executive branch to help resolve melgens business problems official acts prosecutors claim put menendez on the hook under federal bribery law
over the past week prosecutors have specifically tried to focus on the timeline of 600000 donations melgen made to a democratic super pac earmarked for the state of new jersey in 2012 during the time witnesses say and emails show menendez tried to help the doctor resolve a multimilliondollar billing dispute with medicare in melgens favor
the jury also saw email correspondence from may 2012 showing melgens representative agreeing to donate 60000 to menendezs legal defense fund and the new jersey democratic state committee the same day that menendez requested a meeting with a highranking official at the state department to discuss a port security issues in the dominican republic
melgen had acquired a contract with the government in the dominican republic for screening cargo at the islands ports but the agreement had turned sour and prosecutors have tried to convince jurors that menendez sought to influence others to resolve the dispute in melgens favor
the defense team has tried to illustrate through crossexamination of several witnesses that menendez was legitimately concerned about the fairness of medicares billing practices security of cargo entering the us and preventing drug smuggling at ports and never hid his friendship with melgen
legal experts say proving corrupt intent remains the major obstacle for prosecutors in this case especially if the defense offers a persuasive counternarrative for the jury to believe menendez genuinely acted out of broader policy concerns not because melgen paid him off
as columbia law school professor richard briffault explained in an interview with cnn the more the defense team convinces the jury that menendez acted because he thought something was a good idea rather than doing it because there was a deal with melgen the harder it will be for the jury to convict

stream of benefits
after the prosecution rested its case defense attorney abbe lowell urged judge william walls to dismiss the case and enter a judgment of acquittal wednesday based on a failure of the justice department to meet its burden of proof
walls did not rule on the motion but appeared unpersuaded for over three hours of argument the judge engaged in a spirited debate with both sides about the applicability of a 2016 supreme court decision throwing out former virginia gov bob mcdonnells bribery conviction
in that case the justices said that merely setting up a meeting hosting an event or calling an official is no longer sufficient the politician must put his or her thumb on the scale in an ongoing proceeding lawsuit or controversy or exert pressure on someone else to do so
lowell suggested that menendezs conduct did not meet the courts threshold for what now constitutes an official act under federal bribery law because the senator as a member of the legislative branch has only been accused of lobbying executive branch officials on melgens behalf
but walls rejected that argument noting that the mcdonnell case didnt rule out the possibility of interbranch pressure and historically as well as in literature the power of senators particularly senators is acknowledged
the judge additionally pushed prosecutors to articulate how their quid pro quo bribery theory a latin phrase meaning this for that jives with the mcdonnell decision
whats the quid for these quos walls asked im trying to establish a temporal line how you link the quids to the alleged quos
koski emphasized that the prosecutions overarching theory that melgen provided a stream of benefits survives the mcdonnell test but the judge seemed skeptical and asked the lawyers provide written briefs on the issue
court will resume on monday"

"__label__fake 10 important stories from 092617 box scores montgomerys strong start harpers return more
before its news
by ray kuhn
we had a busy tuesday across baseball as the 2017 winds down whether you are making that final push towards a championship getting ready for next season or getting those last few days of dfs in we have you covered lets take a look at some of the performances that stood out from last night
1 hernandez shows off the power
september is all about young players taking advantage of their chance the trade from houston gave teoscar hernandez that chance and he is working towards a 2018 role with the blue jays batting leadoff hernandez went deep twice his first home run was a solo shot off chris sale and then followed it up with a three run blast the problem though is that in his other three at bats hernandez struck out in 73 at bats with toronto this season hernandez has seven home runs and 18 rbi while batting 274 his babip is 317 and it is very possible he holds onto his role for next season
2 cutch has a game
we are past the point now of wondering if andrew mccutchen is truly done or not but last night ensured he is ending the season strong not only did the outfielder go 4 for 4 on tuesday but he went deep twice his two home runs a grand slam and a three run shot gave him 28 on the season and all together the outfielder picked up 8 rbi on the night that leaves mccutchen with 87 rbi on the season along with a 278 batting average sure there will lots of younger more exciting and potential filled options on draft day and you have to keep mccutchens early season struggles in mind but he still has something to offer
3 montgomery has a strong outing
if your streaming carousel brought you to jordan montgomery last night then you should be pleased the rookie picked up his ninth victory of the season at home against tampa bay with six strong innings montgomery held the rays to just one run in six innings of work on six hits and a walk he struck out five while bringing his era down to 396 for the season the yankees plan for montgomery next season will likely depend on how their offseason goes but i wouldnt be surprised to see him back in their rotation on a full time basis he could prove to be a valuable mid or back end of the rotation option if that is the case
4 rosario continues to slug
everyone is going to talk about byron buxton and miguel sano before he got hurt but there are more young players on the twins who do require your attention one of those players is eddie rosario the outfielder has been having a solid year but when sano went down rosario truly has stepped up he went deep in the first inning last night and followed that up with three more hits after picking up 27th home run of the season rosario doubled twice 33 overall and drove in two more runs that brought his rbi total up to 78 to go along with his 292 batting average
5 what will happen with hader next year
we know that josh hader was maybe even still is a top pitching prospect the brewers have given him a chance to start at the triplea level but for multiple reasons the southpaw has struggled and produced eras north of five part of that reason is that milwaukees triplea team is in colorado springs so elevation is certainly an issue however the brewers brought hader to the major leagues this season to work out of the bullpen and all he has done in his 34 outings is dominate last night hader picked up his second victory of the season with 22 innings of two run ball in fact all things considered this was one of his worst outings since he gave up two runs but he did strikeout six as he saw his era jump to 193 hader clearly can pitch at the big league level and get batters out so it wouldnt surprise me to see milwaukee try him as a starter this spring if not we know he has value out of the bullpen
6 maybin drives in three
the astros didnt get cameron maybin to sit on the bench and while hitting for average has been a struggle this season he is still a productive option after his two hit night on tuesday maybin is hitting just 225 on the season but his 270 babip career mark of 316 says this is on the lower scale of what we can expect from him maybins pop was on display last night as he hit a traditional home run a three run shot and also as he he a triple to dead center field and scored on an error in 386 at bats this season maybin has 10 home runs 34 rbi and 33 stolen bases in other words he gives you just enough to keep you hooked from a fantasy perspective on his tools
7 harper returns
as far as fantasy owners are considered this is too little too late bryce harper isnt back to give their fantasy teams a push in the final week of the season instead harper is back to get a few games and at bats in before the playoffs the good thing though is that we are going to get proof that harper is healthy and recovered from his injury prior to next season in reality harpers injury looked worse than it was but it was still a good thing to see the outfielder back on the field in three at bats prior to being replaced harper went 0 for 2 with a walk and a strikeout check the lineup each day before starting him as washington will be careful
8 anderson shuts out miami
after struggling and missing a chunk of the season tyler anderson is back and last night showed why there was some buzz surrounding the southpaw this season now that outlook is always going to be clouded by the fact that anderson does pitch at coors field but early in his career he has shown some potential last night anderson shut the marlins out over seven innings of work while allowing just four hits and striking out five on the season andersons era is 481 in 17 games 15 starts anderson made his fourth start since returning for the disabled list on tuesday and in that stretch he has a 119 era along with a 079 whip in two starts in coors field since his return anderson has thrown 13 shutout innings and he is worth a look
9 another one for jd
this is getting to be insane originally acquired to protect paul goldschmidt in the batting order jd martinez is taking control of things for arizonas offense all martinez did last night was pick up three hits in four at bats he was a triple short of the cycle and martinezs night included his 44th home run of the season which happened to be a grand slam martinez drove in six runs on the night which brought his total for the season to 103 as he raised his batting average to 304 arizona certainly has agreed with martinez and it will be interesting to see where he ends up this offseason
10 seager drives in four
it hasnt been an easy september for the dodgers as they came crashing back to earth corey seager has battled an elbow injury but it didnt appear to impact him at the plate on tuesday the shortstop went deep for the 21st time this season a three run shot and he later added an rbi single 75 for the season while seager is having a solid season some would consider his overall numbers a disappointment although he is batting 295 it was a good sign to see seagers success last night as he is hitting just 195 in 68 at bats so far in september it is possible that seager might be a value pick for 2018 since he didnt take as big a step forward as other young players such as francisco lindor

well this cesspool of a season is finally over and the amount of happiness that gives me is quite disturbing today ended with the flash of a walk off homer by pablo sandoval no less and some loving speeches for a great departing giant but there is nothing that can take away the stink and scars from of this year it started in april really and by may it was a done deal amazing in a sick way this team is different than any of the other big losing squads of my youth and it has affected me more than i ever expected
after years of genuine contention all bets are now off and we all start from scratch truthfully im not sure im up for it any more one thing i learned from this horror of a team is that there are times to walk away from it i regained some of my life by getting away from this team and i liked it so all i can say is that i will let you know about next year and just how much i want to jump in again

"__label__real cnn what did you do on your last plane journey fall asleep watch a movie draft some emails
not architect john gardner a frequent business traveler hes found a way to turn these journeys into an artistic outlet
the bermudabased executive passes time on planes by sketching the sights and scenes he spies on board
sketching is a nice alternative to taking pictures as it is making something by hand and encourages really seeing and remembering and interpreting gardner tells cnn travel
cabin creative
john gardner sketches scenes from his airplane seat
gardner who trained at the rhode island school of design risd has a busy schedule thatll sound familiar to many business travelers
right now im teaching advanced architecture at the rhode island school of design and im going up every weekend to boston from bermuda the 58yearold explains
im doing two flights and two drawings a week he says im in an intense phase right now which is kind of fun
gardners onboard artistic endeavors overlap with his day job but they also allow the architect to experiment with a different medium
in my architectural job im imagining things usually theyre buildings and spaces says gardner in this instance im drawing what i see
gardner captures both intricate details and abstract scenes
what gardner sees includes profiles of other passengers antics of the air stewards stained coffee cups and crumbling pretzels intricate detail of curtains and time spent in the terminal
the results are eyecatching sketches popping with color from his paints that capture life through the business traveler lens sometimes the sketches are abstract evoking a general sense of the onboard experience with overlapping snapshots of air stewards uniforms laptops and fellow passengers
other times theyre more detailed studies of intricate airline scenes
its a creative release gardner says i find the time on the plane is really very valuable because theres nothing else taking me away from where i am
related content flight attendant photographs behind the scenes of virgin america
drawing inspiration
gardner is particularly interested in the antics of the air stewards
its become a creative challenge for gardner to search out prospects hes yet to paint
it is hard sketching and painting what is essentially the same view he says but the style can change and if i look hard enough or relax and just start drawing interesting things reveal themselves
he particularly enjoys sketching flight attendants
gardner will ask his neighboring passengers if they mind being sketched
theyre hard to draw as theyre constantly moving he explains so what ill actually do is ill take a few pictures on my iphone and ill sketch them loosely and then ill tighten it up
gardner is full of praise for cabin crew
the flight attendants are amazing he says ive never had a bad experience they get really interested in what im doing so sometimes i give them my sketchbook and they go take it to the galley and take photos some of the sketches have their names on them
fine art
gardner says the humidity on board the plane is perfect for watercolor
surprisingly gardner says airplane conditions lend themselves perfectly to a spot of painting
the majority of my sketches are are pen and ink and watercolor he says the best thing about watercolor in planes is the humidity is very low so you can paint and it dries very quickly which is really nice
gardner will sketch in every situation aside from take off and landing whatever cabin he ends up in
gardner pictured here painting on board a plane tries his best to sketch in all conditions
what ill do is ask for two waters and a coffee ill drink one water the others for the paint he says i try really hard not to have an accident when its a tight space
naturally its always easier if he flies executive but in economy aisle seats work best
it is virtually impossible to paint in the middle seat with two passengers on either side says gardner everything gets set out on top of the sketchbook and they get nervous the water will spill on them
however gardners fellow travelers are mostly unperturbed by his creative efforts even when theyre the subject of his artistic eye
passengers dont usually know i am drawing them and i ask if they are next to me he says theyll always say yeah thats great
gardner will sketch subjects in the airport terminals as well as on board
in the terminal gardner will sketch faces from far away
hes also become interested in the limited onboard lighting
he lists inspirations as the light from the windows the pattern of the chairs the red lights the ubiquitous exit signs the food in front of you the industrial engineering the grays and blues
related content would you live in an airport for 30 days one man is giving it a try
worldwide feedback
gardner has recently set up an instagram account to share his sketches
as every frequent flier knows time on the plane can be draining and feel unfulfilling
for gardner his sketches allows him to appreciate the everyday and find satisfaction in the mundane
it makes the memory of the flight particularly interesting he says more interesting than if i just got on and got off
i find at the end of the flight i look at the sketch and its revealed something about the environment i was in says gardner something i wasnt looking for but it happened
gardners students at risd inspired him to share his work
gardner has been sketching intensively for the past five years and hes kept a sketchbook since his student days at risd but its only recently that hes started sharing his work with a wider audience
ive been very private about my artwork because ive really been an architect he says
in the last few years ive just been exploring a bit more energy on my artwork with the view of being a more serious artist
it was gardners undergraduates at risd who encouraged him to share his sketches on social media
i was prompted by the younger generation he says and i was comfortable enough on my own terms that my drawings were ready to be out there
now hes got a fledgling instagram account tagging his on board artwork with paintingonplanes
its early days gardners already inspired and excited by the virtual feedback
the response is this huge worldwide array of people who pick up your work he says i think thats just fascinating and then i see what theyre interested in and its this whole portal to having a broader perspective around the world of whats going on
related content surreal photos of earth from a window seat
appreciating the everyday
gardner finds painting on planes a rewarding and fun experience
gardner also encourages others to follow in his footsteps to find new ways to appreciate their commute and everyday routine whether through sketching or other mediums
the trick he says is commitment and patience
the key is really to have a sketchbook and carry it with you everywhere gardner advises when you get a spare moment whether its on the plane or in a café or waiting at the airport just start doodling and drawing youll be amazed at where youll end up in one two or five years
for gardner its been a revolutionary experience"

"__label__real craiova romania reuters nato ally turkey is not seeking to antagonize the usled alliance by purchasing russian s400 surfacetoair missiles and is in talks with france and italy to buy similar weapons nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg said
ankaras decision to buy the russian system has been seen in some western capitals as a snub to the alliance given tensions with moscow over ukraine and syria while the deal raised concern because the weapons cannot be integrated into nato defense
but stoltenberg said it was a sovereign decision and that he had talked it through with turkish president tayyip erdogan
there hasnt been any request from turkey to integrate the s400 into nato air defense system stoltenberg told reuters in an interview on a belgian military plane returning from romania late on monday
i spoke with president erdogan when i met him in september i said that the kind of capabilities different nations want to acquire is a national decision he said of the s400 system that turkey has made an advance payment for and hopes to see delivered in 2019
stoltenberg stressed that top turkish officials as well as erdogan had told him ankara remained a strong nato ally
that was despite the s400 issue and a dispute with germany over erdogans arrest of german nationals as part of a mass purge following last julys failed coup bid
stoltenberg said ankara was ready to brief its allies in the usled 29member bloc on the reasons behind its decision to buy the s400 system
erdogan has blamed nato countries for failing to propose a viable alternative to the longrange russian missiles but stoltenberg said erdogan was now talking to paris and rome for similar systems a move the alliance chief welcomed
he told me that turkey is in dialogue with france and italy on possible delivery of air defense systems from them on top of the s400 stoltenberg said
stoltenberg did not give more details but said turkey was familiar with the socalled sampt missiles developed because italy had stationed them in turkey as part of nato efforts to help protect ankara from rocket attacks
such weapons are designed to protect battlefields and strategic sites such as airports and sea ports against airborne threats including cruise missiles and aircraft
the sampt system is produced by italianfrench consortium eurosam a joint venture between european missile maker mbda and thales
russia uses different technology as well as knowhow that moscow is unlikely to be willing to share experts say
for nato the important thing is interoperability stoltenberg said speaking on his return from the launch of a nato force aimed at deterring russia in the black sea region
we encourage facilitate allies to develop systems acquire and operate systems together that will reduce costs and strengthen the defense industries within the alliance he said
zapad mistrust
as part of natos collective defense pledge the allies integrate their ships planes and weapons systems to make them work together as well as sharing command across the alliance
some eastern european allies that were once under soviet rule still rely on russianmade planes but integrating russias most advanced groundbased missile system would also be highly complicated for political reasons
while stoltenberg a former norwegian prime minister took up the nato post three years ago with a more conciliatory tone toward moscow than his danish predecessor anders fogh rasmussen russias crimea annexation in march 2014 had already badly damaged eastwest ties
in the latest dispute stoltenberg said moscow had given misleading information about the size of its war games known as zapad or west last month
our assessment so far shows that the scale and geographic scope of the zapad exercise significantly exceeded what was announced he said although he said so far there were no signs russia had left behind troops or weapons in belarus during the exercises as some baltic nations had feared
russia said zapad involved some 13000 troops and has accused nato allies of exaggerating the size of the drills"

"__label__real the sports xchange nfl players association executive director demaurice smith released a statement monday regarding players protesting during the national anthem saying no player is disrespecting our country or our flag
smiths statement comes following dallas cowboys owner jerry jones comments on sunday that his players must stand for the anthem or else they would not play
in addition vice president mike pence left sundays game in indianapolis when the visiting san francisco 49ers knelt during the national anthem before facing the colts
last week both the commissioner and the chair of the nfl management council john mara were clear when they assured our union leaders in the presence of other owners that they would respect the constitutional rights of our members without retribution smith said in a statement i look forward to the day when everyone in management can unite and truly embrace and article what that flag stands for liberty and justice for all instead of some of them just talking about standing we look forward to continuing our talks with them on this very issue
no player is disrespecting our country or our flag as thousands have shown in the past it takes bravery and courage to speak and confront these issues as our players have especially when it is unpopular with some there is room for management to do the same and maybe then players do not have to risk the taunts and threats alone this is their opportunity to lead as well and will be a true test of the motto that football is family
jones comments occurred in response to pence abruptly leaving sundays game after more than 20 49ers knelt during the national anthem
understand we will not if we are disrespecting the flag then we will not play period jones said after the cowboys 3531 home loss to the green bay packers
before the cowboys game at arizona on sept 25 jones and members of his family joined the players coaches and staff on the field prior to the anthem they kneeled and locked arms when the anthem was performed they stood arminarm with the players
the gesture was in response to president donald trumps comments that nfl owners should fire players who disrespect the flag by not standing during the national anthem
cowboys defensive ends damontre moore and david irving raised their fists at the end of the anthem before the game against the packers according to the dallas morning news jones said he was unaware of their actions

pence a former governor of indiana was on hand to celebrate former colts quarterback peyton mannings induction into the franchises ring of honor
no colts players knelt during the anthem prior to the game but the 49ers had more than 20 players kneeling with their hands over their hearts for the second straight week
i left todays colts game because potus and i will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers our flag or our national anthem pence tweeted about leaving the game
about an hour later trump tweeted that pence was acting in response to his instructions
i asked vp pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled disrespecting our country i am proud of him and secondlady karen trump tweeted
nbc news reported sunday that reporters were told before the game there could be an early departure by pence
trump followed up monday morning with another tweet the trip by vp pence was long planned he is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country
trumps position unified more nfl players to protest racial injustice before or during the anthem he said during a political rally in huntsville ala on sept 22 that nfl owners should fire the players who knelt during the anthem
were proud of our country we respect our flag trump said to loud applause at the campaign event wouldnt you love to see one of these nfl owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say get that son of a bitch off the field right now out hes fired hes fired
former san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick drew national attention last season when he knelt during the national anthem as a protest against racial injustice a number of players followed kaepernicks lead by taking a knee during the anthem last year
nfl players who have demonstrated during the national anthem have said they are protesting police brutality and racism but not the flag or the anthem itself"

"__label__real a worker adjusts the us flag before japanese prime minister shinzo abe addresses media following a meeting with presidentelect donald trump in manhattan new york us november 17 2016 reutersandrew kelly
tokyo reuters japan will propose changes to its safeguard mechanism on frozen us beef imports that will shorten review periods and allow importers to voluntarily lower import volumes to prevent tariffs from automatically kicking in two government sources said on thursday
the proposal will be made at the second round of the usjapan economic dialogue in washington on oct 16 but it is uncertain if the us side will go along said the two sources who have direct knowledge of the matter
if successful the proposal could help ward off trade friction with the united states which is renegotiating free trade agreements with other countries to protect jobs and lower its trade deficit
under current measures japan automatically imposes higher tariffs if quarterly imports of specific beef products from any country rise more than 17 percent from the previous year
japan hiked tariffs from aug 1 on imports of frozen beef popular in beef bowl dishes from countries including the united states to 50 percent from 385 percent
the move followed us president donald trumps withdraw from the longplanned transpacific partnership trade deal earlier this year
japan says the tariff hike set to be in place until next march is a safeguard mechanism to protect domestic farmers but it has prompted some concern in washington
instead of reviewing import data on a quarterly basis japan will propose shortening this period to every 10 days the sources said this will make it easier for companies that import beef to adjust volumes and avoid triggering tariffs the sources said
however the plan is far from certain to work because frozen us beef imports could surge next year in april after the current tariff increase expires one source said
once the safeguard is triggered there is a concern that it will repeatedly be triggered in the future the source said
the first round of the usjapan economic dialogue which was held in tokyo in april ended largely without incident however there is some concern among japanese officials that the us side could strongly push for trade concession during the second dialogue meeting
japan had a 69billion trade surplus with the united states last year according to the us treasury department which has expressed concern over what it called the persistence of the imbalance
japanese officials counter that tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the us deficit than in the past while chinas imbalance is much bigger"
"__label__real paris reuters france offered on thursday to mediate in a political crisis pitting iraqs government against kurdish regional authorities and promised to maintain a military presence there until islamic state was defeated
the offer by president emmanuel macron coincided with a visit by iraqs prime minister haider alabadi his first abroad since its kurdishheld northern regions last month voted for independence in a referendum declared illegal by baghdad
the iraqi government has imposed sanctions in response to the independence vote but abadi said on thursday he could understand the kurds aspirations provided they were expressed in accordance with the constitution and wanted to avoid violence
we do not want an armed confrontation we dont want clashes abadi said speaking alongside macron but the federal authority must prevail and nobody can infringe on the federal authority
the outcome of the referendum has raised concerns in iraq and abroad that a conflict might break out there along ethnic lines potentially weakening a usbacked campaign against islamic state which still holds pockets of territory in iraq and syria
macron whose country is the secondbiggest contributor to the campaign said french forces would remain until the militant groups defeat was total
it is vital in the coming weeks and months that a dialogue begins that respects the unity integrity and sovereignty of iraq within the framework of the constitution and recognizing kurdish rights macron added
france is ready if iraqi authorities wish to actively contribute to the mediation launched by the united nations
iraqikurdish tensions were ratcheted down a notch on wednesday when the central bank in baghdad eased financial restrictions imposed after the vote after receiving a pledge of cooperation from kurdish banks an iraqi banking source said
the central bank had said on tuesday it would halt all foreign currency transfers to the region banking and government sources told reuters all but four kurdishowned banks were on wednesday again allowed to send and receive dollar and foreign currency transfers the first banking source said nl8n1mf2om
abadi in paris for bilateral talks said the iraqis and kurds had a common interest in maintaining peace
he had on tuesday called for a joint administration of oilrich kirkuk and other areas claimed by both his government and the autonomous kurdish region provided baghdad had ultimate authority in any such arrangement
kurdish peshmerga fighters took control of kirkuk in 2014 when iraqi forces collapsed in the face of islamic states advance across northern iraq
i call on the peshmerga to remain an integral part of the iraqi forces under the authority of the federal authorities to guarantee the security of citizens so that we can rebuild these zones abadi said referring to areas taken back from islamic state militants
we respect the aspirations of all citizens including the kurds i respect those aspirations but we must work together we are in one country

"__label__real this feature is part of cnn parallels an interactive series exploring ways you can improve your health by making small changes to your daily habits
cnn water is known as the elixir of life with good reason every system in your body needs it to survive
water regulates our body temperature keeps our joints lubricated helps prevent infections and delivers nutrients to our cells said registered us dietitian and cnn contributor lisa drayer additionally our kidneys and liver work hard to get rid of toxins in our bodies and they depend on water to do their job
water makes up about 60 of your bodys weight and although you can survive without food for weeks dehydration can kill you within days or even hours depending on the temperature and your environment
dehydration means more water is moving out of your bodys cells than into them and as this happens its not just water that you lose small amounts of electrolytes critical to cell function and energy such as sodium and potassium are lost along with the water
youre constantly losing water and electrolytes throughout the day via breath sweat urine and bowel movements so even mild dehydration can exhaust you and affect many of your bodys daily functions
hydration and your health
you could quickly become constipated as your colon steals water from your stool to keep your digestive system moving urine will become darker prolonged dehydration can also crystallize salts and minerals in urine possibly leading to the formation of painful kidney stones
because dehydration can often be mistaken for hunger you might gain weight as you try to satisfy your bodys needs fortunately the opposite is also true if youre hydrated
if you are looking to lose weight water can help you shed pounds drayer said drinking a glass of water before a meal can fill you up a bit and help you eat fewer calories at a meal
if you suffer from migraines studies show that a lack of fluids might easily trigger an episode headaches are also likely to last longer if youre low on fluids in addition dehydration can leave you unable to concentrate cause shortterm memory problems and leave you feeling moody and anxious
when youre wellhydrated your sleep quality is better your cognition is better you function better your mood is better the list goes on said douglas casa ceo of the university of connecticuts korey stringer institute which studies athletic performance another area that benefits from drinking enough fluids
we did a study on people who were mildly dehydrated which can happen within just 30 minutes of exercise casa said and we found mood was compromised in both men and women
signs of dehydration
the signs of dehydration differ by age group infants and young children may not be able to recognize their need for fluids so its critical to provide frequent fluid intake and keep an eye out for symptoms of dehydration irritability or lethargy no tears when crying no wet diapers for as little as three hours a dry mouth and tongue sunken eyes and cheeks and a shrinking of the soft spot on top of head
adults show much different signs of dehydration including fatigue dizziness confusion lessfrequent urination and extreme thirst but the latter has one exception the elderly older adults may not feel thirsty but can still be dehydrated
thats why one of the best ways to tell whether youre lacking fluids is by the color of your urine
the morning is the best time to get a global sense of your hydration status casa advised if your urine looks more like apple juice instead of lemonade then youre dehydrated on the flip side the need to urinate throughout the day is a sign that youre wellhydrated
additional causes of dehydration
a lack of fluids is not the only cause of dehydration certain blood pressure and diuretic medications can increase urination as can diabetes that has not been diagnosed or isnt well controlled
a sudden and extreme episode of diarrhea or vomiting can remove a large amount of fluids in a short amount of time add a high fever and you could be in trouble quickly upping fluid intake is critical
sweating due to hot humid conditions or extreme physical activity is another sure way to become quickly dehydrated athletes and those who work outside have to be especially careful to avoid heat injuries including muscle cramps heat exhaustion and seizures
hypovolemic shock in which low blood volume causes a drop in oxygen and blood pressure is the most serious form of dehydration and can be life threatening
the many sources of water
whats the best way to stay hydrated drinking plain water of course cant be beat its readily available and has zero calories
but what if like many americans you dont like the taste of water drayer suggests adding fruit or vegetables such as lemons berries and orange or cucumber slices to enhance the flavor
the national academies of medicine recommends a little over 11 cups 27 liters of fluids a day for the average woman and almost 16 cups 37 liters for men though that may sound difficult to achieve the fluids can come from many sources besides water including food
i often remind people that brothbased soup as well as other beverages including tea coffee and milk count towards your daily fluid intake drayer said also vegetables including cucumbers lettuce celery and tomatoes and fruits including watermelon cantaloupe and strawberries
why dont americans like to drink water because we are conditioned to expect high levels of sweetness in everything said renowned nutritionist dr walter willett professor of nutrition and epidemiology at harvard th chan school of public health
and that has led to a lot of problems he added high levels of sugar have adverse metabolic effects and the amounts we get in beverages today is so huge that it is one of our major health issues
willett who is also a professor of medicine at harvard medical school has published over 1700 research papers and reviews on lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease
you might say we are malhydrated because we drink so much soda and fruit juice and other sugarsweetened beverages and by that i mean we drink beverages that harm our health he said even energy drinks and vitamin waters most are loaded with sugar and not worth the use
calculate your fluids
to help people make better choices about their fluid intake the american society for clinical nutritions beverage guidance counsel created a pitcher of liquids to illustrate at a glance how much of each fluid is considered best for optimal health though it was created in 2006 willett who served on the council said the guidance holds true today
the vast majority of your daily fluid intake should come from water in this illustration a person on a 2200calorie diet would drink about 50 fluid ounces of water a day which is just over 6 cups 14 liters another 28 fluid ounces which is 35 cups or just over 800 milliliters could come from coffee or tea
there are health benefits to coffee studies show it can help with diabetes and has some modest cardiovascular benefits willett said its a mild antidepressant in fact studies show about a 50 lower risk of suicide of with three to four cups of coffee a day
tea has about a third the amount of caffeine as coffee so youre much less likely to have sleep problems he added but we dont see as many health benefits for tea as coffee
the next choice in the fluid pyramid is skim milk also sold as 1 milk as well as soy or other unsweetened alternatives such as almond milk for adults who wish to add that beverage to their diet the maximum amount per day would be two cups almost 500 milliliters
milk is really complicated area because it comes along with saturated fat willett said and even lowfat milk is high in calories up to two servings a day is fine but going beyond that is excessive
level four in the diagram includes diet sodas teas and other beverages with noncalorie artificial or natural sweeteners such as aspartame sucralose and stevia because there is growing evidence that these drinks might contribute to weight gain willett says they should be seen as an occasional treat they are listed in the pitcher as no more than 16 ounces a day 2 cups or almost 500 milliliters keep in mind that a typical can of soda is 12 ounces
then come alcohol whole fat milk sports drinks vitamin enhanced waters and fruit and vegetable juices yes even fruit and veggie drinks are capped at 4 ounces a day
fruit juices are cautionary because they contain about the same amount of sugar as soda willett said orange juice has nutritional value apple juice much less so we recommend choosing orange over apple juice
alcoholic beverages are complicated he added there are definite protective health benefits against heart disease for both sexes but for women even a half a drink a day can raise the risk of breast cancer so if youre not at risk for heart disease theres no benefit in preventing it so theres no reason to drink he said thats why alcohol is listed on the diagram as zero fluid ounces toward your daily amount
the last category is reserved for sugar or high fructose corn syrup sweetened beverages such as regular soda lemonade and fruit drinks willett says those get a thumbs down because they provide no nutritional value and plenty of calories
join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter
taken as a whole willett said the pitcher recommendations should come as a wake up call for anyone looking to quench their thirst
the most important message is the source of the hydration he said beverages can cause real harm people are not dying of dehydration in america so choosing beverages other than water and other healthy sources has major health implications"
"__label__fake week 4 prediction article oakland raiders denver broncos
before its news
good morning bronco fans it is week 4 in the nfl as we are back at home against our division rivals the oakland raiders both teams come into this contest with a record of 21 after losing in week 3 both teams will look to rebound and continue to chase the division leading 30 kansas city chiefs
oakland is coming off of a 2710 loss to the redskins and denver is coming off of a 2616 loss to the buffalo bills last week against the redskins the oakland raiders couldnt muster up any offensive momentum as the redskins dominated them throughout the whole game qb derek carr was just 19 of 31 passing with 118 yards oakland will also be without the services of wr michael crabtree who is inactive today due to an injury rb marshawn beast mode lynch will look to rebound after a poor start last week in which he had just 6 carries for 18 yards
denver will look to avoid making costly mistakes on offense as trevor siemian knows he must protect the billion dollar football turnovers have been a huge momentum killer for the broncos this season as siemian has now thrown 4 interceptions on the season denver certainly has the offensive weapons to give opposing teams nightmares with arguably one of the best wr duos in the league demaryius thomas and emmanuel sanders have combined for 33 receptions 399 yards and 2 touchdowns while wr bennie fowler is also making his presence known with 8 catches for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns of his own
the denver defense is ranked 1 in the nfl against the rush allowing just under 60 yards per game their defense is also ranked 4th overall allowing 263 yards per game washington showed the world how to manhandle and beat the raiders so the broncos will just need to follow suit
5 keys to victory
get pressure on derek carr last week carr was sacked 4 times and pressured all day long with the denver secondary locking down receivers and the ferocious pass rush of the broncos getting into carrs head early will be a huge factor in this game
continue to run the football with rbs cj anderson and jamal charles the broncos have a formidable twoheaded rushing attack anderson is averaging 44 yards per carry as charles is averaging 51 yards per carry establish the run early and continue to pound the ball rush for over 100 yards and i can see a denver victory
keep siemian upright oakland boasts one of the best pass rushers in the nfl with khalil mack mack has the ability to single handily disrupt the flow of a game and make huge game changing plays protect the qb
again win the turnover battle siemian must protect the football this includes interceptions and strip sacks always know where khalil mack is and make smart throws not throws across your body that goes to the other team
do not allow marshawn lynch to go into beast mode denver is going to have to attack the ball carrier hold on tight and gang tackle lynch will run through arm tackles and make defenses pay dearly
final score prediction
oakland raiders 13

"__label__fake doesnt pay to be ordinary on defense
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
one of the reasons yards allowed is such a misleading statistic is that defense lives on the variation of yardage to stop drives said otherwise an offense can move the ball robotically up the field with average run or pass results each play its the defense which requires substantial variation of result to stop drives primarily in the form of turnovers sacks offensive penalties and key incomplete passes
so how did the ravens fare in these categories versus the jags
 no turnovers
 no sacks
 the jags committed 2 holding penalties which did not stall drives
 they also had a holing flag and a false start on the same series of downs where they still managed to get a fg
 while bortles had 8 incomplete passes in the first half only 1 stalled a drive resulting in a punt and only 1 other was in the same set of downs that resulted in settling for a fg
take out the kneels and the fake punt and the ravens allowed a solid 36 ypc and 55 yard per play on all competitive defensive snaps but the ravens defense failed in terms of the pressure required to make the highvariation plays
not scheming for pressure
here are a few supporting details
 pees called for just 3 blitzes from off the line of scrimmage onwuasor mosley correa
 the ravens had only 1 blitz that was deceptive by my definition the first pass of the game had onwuasors blitz coupled with a stunt by suggs
 bortles had ample time and space ats on 15 of 24 plays in the first half
 of the 9 firsthalf drop backs which were not ats 5 were designed to have the ball out quickly and were not pressure generated by the pass rush
if youre reading this piece after a beating like the ravens just took youve seen me present this chart and supporting details many times before with a summary in words ill tell you whatyou caption this in 1 or 2 pithy sentences put it in the comments and ill make sure to mention the best ones on the podcast to be clear im not looking for the pass rush sucked but something that provides a little more insightexplanation as to why
individual notes by positional group
defensive line
the line was taxed heavily as the defense returned to many more 4db sets and 25 defensive linemen per play that coupled with the absence of brandon williams and injury to urban left the ravens shorthanded
willie henry 40 snaps made his nfl debut on defense in addition to 4 run stuffs gains of 3 1 1 3 he lined up as a 1 3 and 5 tech he was flagged for encroachment an ongoing concern after leading the team in penalties during the preseason willie didnt generate any pressure in 18 pass snaps but his play lends hope that the dl can hold up with the absence of williams and urban
carl davis 42 snaps had his play increased sharply similar to henry he had 3 run stuffs 1 2 0 and drew 1 flag he also generated 1 pressure in 18 passrush snaps
michael pierce 55 snaps also was effective versus the run with 3 stuffs 2 3 2 the issue with run defense wasnt in the middle as well discuss michael had no pressure events in 27 pass rush snaps
brent urban was lost for the season after 18 snaps he had been the ravens iron man so far this season and a good source of interior pass rush 1 pd vs jags the ravens have bronson kaufusi available as the most obvious 5tech replacement for urban but i wont be surprised if they activate both him and chris wormley vs the steelers if williams must sit again the combination of wormley and kaufusi give the option for fresh inside pass rushers in a game where the pressure must be effective
patrick ricard 5 snaps on defense played sparingly despite the scarcity of linemen of his snaps 4 came in goalline formations where the ravens used all 4 available down linemen
linebackers
the ravens activated all 8 of their linebackers 5 olbs 3 ilbs
here are the total snaps pass snaps and pressure events for each of the olbs
this is the group that let the ravens down most especially considering the mediocre jags ots parnell robinson who played the bulk of the snaps in addition all of the big runs allowed to rbs came on the edge
tyus bowser 8 snaps regressed badly after being named defensive rookie of the week versus the browns he was the first to lose marcedes lewis in man coverage for a touchdown q1 339 when he bit on the tes playaction chip block and did not follow his release until it was much too late he lost the right edge to te koyack which helped lead fournettes 15yard run right q1 500 he capped his day by losing the left edge to the fb bohanon on ivorys 9yard run left q3 324 it was on that play that mosley was visibly upset bowser was removed and did not return
kamalei correa 22 snaps had his best career game his highlights
 q1 725 he pursued quickly to take down fournette for a gain of 5 2 3 yac between the numbers and right hash
 q2 216 he came on a welltimed blitz off the offensive left side to deliver an unblocked qh on bortles who grounded his screen pass
 q4 851 he had tight coverage of bohanon by the right sideline and undercut the short route for a pd and near int
he appears to be taking a different stance closer to the line of scrimmage than mosley since i dont see how that would help in coverage i assume its a mechanism to get him to make a quicker impact on run plays
patrick onwuasor 33 snaps got the start he finished with 7 tackles including 3 run stuffs 1 an assist which masked a mediocre day in coverage in particular he missed a tackle to allow 4 yards after contact by lee q1 205 appeared to lose coverage of grant on his 18yard reception q3 1343 and failed to cover bohanon well on his 8yard reception 1 7 yac q3 119 by the right sideline
secondary
jimmy smith 53 snaps played well he was beaten for a 13yard completion by cole q1 423 despite outstanding coverage by the right sideline he otherwise did not allow a reception to his assignment and registered 2 pds 1 on a big hit of bohanon q3 1211
marlon humphrey 21 snaps extended his playing time and continued to produce at a high level to summarize his highlights
 q2 504 he both stripped and forced out lee in the right side of the end zone
 q2 213 he undercut bortles 20yard pass for cole between the numbers and left hash for a pd and near int but the play was negated by webbs illegal contact flag across the field
 q2 125 he had close coverage leapt to knock the ball away and was called for a tickytack dpi versus lee down the left sideline for 29 yards
 q2 046 he had tight coverage and was credited with a pd on a ball cole lost off his fingertips smith had contact on this play that looked much more like pass interference than the previous play
he again had the lowest yards per play of any ravens defender 38 including a large personal contribution for the season the ravens have allowed just 27 yards per play with him in and 58 yards per play with him on the sideline
tony jefferson 61 snaps didnt impact the game as ravens fans would have hoped which is something that almost has to be true in a game where the opposing te has 3 td catches jefferson had excellent man coverage of lewis in the back of the end zone q1 1033 as the defense stiffened to hold the jags to their first fg however he was victimized in man coverage by lewis who split wide for his 3rd td from an initial jumbo set q3 754 bortles threw a simple jump ball it wasnt really a fade to the 66 lewis against which jefferson had good success in 2016
in the interest of forgetting this debacle well dispense with the 3 defensive stars of the game

strip an economy of capital productive incentives talent and yes ethics and what are we left with an economy spiraling toward an inevitable collapse
financialization is destroying the real economy but few in power seem to notice or care the reason why is painfully obvious those in power are reaping vast fortunes from the engines of financializationfor example former president obama obama goes from white house to wall street in less than one year
this is not to single out president obama as a special case politicos across the spectrum depend on the engines of financialization to fund their campaigns and make them multimillionaires and corporate managers and financiers have skimmed billions of dollars in gains not from producing new better and more affordable goods and services but by playing financialization games such as borrowing billions to buy back stocks leveraged buyouts and so onall of which have reaped the insiders gargantuan fortunes while hollowing out the real economy
financialization necessarily hollows out the real economy as gordon long and i detail in this new video program the results of financialization part i 34 minutes
the key dynamic is that financialization creates irresistible incentives to ramp up debt and leverage at the expense of the real economy those who fail to exploit financialization will underperform the market and be fired
as gordon explains if a ceo refuses to load a company up with debt a privateequity financier with access to cheap federal reserve credit will scoop up the company in a private buyout fire the management extract immense profits by loading the company with debt then take the hollowedout shell public again reaping another windfall of financialized gains
note that the privateequity financiers have every incentive to lay off employees especially experienced workers who earn higher salaries to reduce costs before they take the hollowedout shell public how can corporations pay out more to shareholders than they actually earned easyfinancialization another key dynamic in financialization is limitless liquidity and super low interest rates set by central banksrates that are so low and liquidity so abundant that corporations can roll over their debt and actually add more debt and keep their interest payments unchanged
this dynamic inevitably leads to zombie corporationscorporations with low rates of growth and profitability and high debt loads that in an unfinancialized economy would be recognized as insolvent and liquidated
as we explain financialization skews the riskreward in favor of financial games so realworld investments no longer make sense why risk building a factory in the us or training workers when the payoff is uncertain when there are so many ways to reap immense fortunes via financial games that are ultimately backstopped by the federal reserve or federal agencies ie the taxpayers
as many observers have noted these perverse incentives have siphoned human talent away from productive employment and into enormously wellcompensated but parasitic exploitative financializationrelated jobs
strip an economy of capital productive incentives talent and yes ethics and what are we left with an economy spiraling toward an inevitable collapse the metaphor ive used to explain this in the past is the yellowstone forest fire the deadwood of bad debt extreme leverage zombie companies and all the other fallen branches of financialization pile up but the central banks no longer allow any creative destruction of unpayable debt and misallocated capital every brush fire is instantly suppressed with more stimulus more liquidity and lower interest rates
as a result the deadwood sapping the real economy of productivity and innovation is allowed to pile higher
the only possible output of this suppression is an economy piled high with explosive risk eventually nature supplies a lightning strike and the resulting conflagration consumes the entire economy
i explain all this in greater detail in my short book why our status quo failed and is beyond reform

photo
were changing up the point of entry mr schwartz said if you were a fan of the original it honors the spirit of that and then those new to the show should be ready for a fun twisted serial
downton abbey and billions have showed that viewers still enjoy the foibles of the rich but reboots have become iffy propositions with originals readily available on amazon prime and in dvd box sets the revival of dallas on tnt was canceled after three seasons in 2014 even with the draw of original cast members dynasty has none thus far one gordon thomson called the new show an abomination in an interview with the daily beast some fans however have hopefully proposed heather locklear the original sammy jo and another melrose veteran to play alexis cristals archrival
but she was nowhere in evidence here this summer on a cavernous soundstage which was home to an update of the carrington mansion where this reporter spent many happy escapist hours as a preteen learning nothing less than how to be a woman
lipplumping treatments mr show compactly handsome at 55 was muttering in between takes rolling the phrase around in his mouth like one of the topshelf brandies mr forsythes blake carrington favored lipplumping treatments
blake had just delivered to his headstrong daughter fallon elizabeth gillies the bad news that their family name had been trademarked by her mother his exwife alexis for a cosmetics line
photo
the dynasty name was also tarnished by the time mr show met mr spelling whose holmby hills calif mansion seemed a version of blake carringtons on melrose he remembered the older man as strict and stingy using socalled honey wagons to remove sewage rather than install proper plumbing but also possessing a certain thespian gravitas
advertisement continue reading the main story
aaron used to say putting his hands up and framing your face in a very square just your face way my shows are all about character mr show said during a break in taping sitting at a dining table surrounded by expensive art he filmed straighton close to camera you could tell an aaron show in less than a second
the new dynasty in contrast has ms savage and mr schwartzs own distinct aesthetic scenes are shorter three or four minutes as opposed to six or seven skirts are also shorter music is louder lighting is dimmer slomo is occasionally deployed and knowing references are rife including to trumps kardashians and murdochs
that the white house currently contains a realestate tycoon familiar from the 80s yet and his scions makes dynasty seem particularly resonant though of course tangling bloodlines are a dramatic device as old as the ancient greeks from the clintons to the kennedys this isnt a new thing our fascination with these really powerful families said nathalie kelley who plays cristal but one thing weve talked about which is interesting is patriarchy how much it has shifted and how much its stayed the same
the former krystle linda evans had been blakes secretary positioned in perpetual saintly opposition to the devious alexis and meekly tiptoeing around the carrington mansion like the nameless heroine of daphne du mauriers rebecca
photo
in the original blake is shutting the door in her face because she has to have a meeting and shes trying to get a word in about the china or something ms kelley said shes not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house
this cristal begins in public relations and goes on to contest fiercely with fallon to become chief operating officer of the carrington energy company
she is also young enough to be his daughter though ms kelley argued that at 33 she is past an age that could provoke eye rolls when i first met with josh and stephanie i was like i think cristal needs to be at least in her 30s she said i dont think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone whos under 30 and that threshold makes a big difference
as mr show put it people are younger today the whole shows younger
indeed if any demographic is neglected in the new version it is the modern maturity set ms collins was 48 when she first swept into the courtroom when blake was being tried for the murder of his son stevens male lover mr forsythe was 63 later additions from the golden age of hollywood diahann carroll and rock hudson were in their 50s the latters death of aids in 1985 provoking a national conversation about whether hed jeopardized ms evanss health with their onscreen kiss

as the cast awaits its alexis conflict has been heightened between cristal and fallon a role played first by pamela sue martin then known for nancy drew and the poseidon adventure and subsequently by the british actress emma samms in one of those switcheroos that soap viewers are supposed to accept unblinkingly but now discuss for years afterward in searchable online forums a casting change for steven was attributed to plastic surgery following an explosive accident on an oil rig but producers decided simply to ignore fallons change in appearance
photo
as embodied by ms gillies fallon has been upgraded from a somewhat lost soul climbing in and out of beds and winsomely up trees and later on a spinoff called the colbys being abducted by aliens to an ambitious businesswoman still sleeping with the chauffeur but now also leaning in with a steely glare
ms gillies 24 said she had admired ms collins since seeing her in the flintstones in viva rock vegas as a child and now regularly retweets the older womans throwback thursday hashtags to her own 46 million followers thanks mainly to her role on victorious im not playing alexis but fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto ms gillies said shes less passive than at least pamela sue martin was she had a relaxed nature i wouldnt say that my fallon is as relaxed for better or for worse i think shes got a lot more bite
she is also entwined enough with blake that some early viewers have suggested her character resembles ivanka trump and for them ms gillies has developed a oneline rejoinder i have better shoes she said striding away in a pair of christian louboutin heels
neither iteration of dynasty can be separated from its devotion to materialism and the one percent i just have memories of how white the rooms were the carpet thats what the rich have said ms patrick the showrunner who grew up in atlanta
but the very rich are not only different from you and me but from how they used to be the 2017 colbys made their money in tech the carrington children are concerned about the environment and everyone accepts differences in race and sexual orientation unblinkingly the once dithering steven is now gay and proud ms patrick said thats not his issue with his father its that hes a liberal
mr show said he thought this blake has a lot more pathology than his predecessor crew members were hammering behind him at the opulent set with its staircase built for flouncing down oharastyle and twinkling chandeliers
he tells untruths when he doesnt need to and i dont know why yet im developing the character mr show said im taking that as seriously as i possibly can and then it cuts to a catfight"

macron said he supported a new type of contract based on farmers production costs which would require stronger producer organizations and a change in legislation

last year a third of farmers earned less than 350 euros 403 a month the agricultural mutual assistance association msa said a third of the net minimum wage
macron endorsed a proposal from the workshops to create a reversed contract starting from farmers to food processors and to retailers this would ensure a better spread of added value along the chain
we should allow farmers not to rely on subsidies anymore and therefore ensure than they be paid a fair amount for their work macron told farmers and food industry players at the rungis food market near paris

"__label__real one of the more interesting facts in esther perels new book state of affairs rethinking infidelity comes near the beginning
since 1990 notes the psychoanalyst and writer the rate of married women who report theyve been unfaithful has increased by 40 percent while the rate among men has remained the same
more women than ever are cheating she tells us or are willing to admit that they are cheating and while perel spends much of her book examining the psychological meaning motivation and impact of these affairs she offers little insight into the significance of the rise itself
so what exactly is happening inside marriages to shift the numbers what has changed about monogamy or family life in the past 27 years to account for the closing gap and why have so many women begun to feel entitled to the kind of behavior long accepted albeit disapprovingly as a male prerogative
these questions first occurred to me a few years ago when i began to wonder how many of my friends were actually faithful to their husbands
from a distance they seemed happy enough or at least content like me they were doing the family thing they had cute kids mortgages busy social lives matching sets of dishes on the surface their husbands were reasonable the marriages modern and equitable if these women friends were angry unfulfilled or resentful they didnt show it
then one day one of them confided in me shed been having two overlapping affairs over the course of five years
almost before id finished processing this another friend told me she was 100 percent faithful to her husband except when she was out of town for work each month not long after another told me that while shed never had sex with another man shed had so many emotional affairs and inappropriate email correspondences over the years that shed had to buy a separate hard drive to store them all
what surprised me most about these conversations was not that my friends were cheating but that many of them were so nonchalant in the way they described their extramarital adventures there was deception but little secrecy or shame
often they loved their husbands but felt in some fundamental way that their needs sexual emotional psychological were not being met inside the marriage some even wondered if their husbands knew about their infidelity choosing to look away
the fact is one of these friends told me im nicer to my husband when i have something special going on thats just for me she found that she was kinder more patient less resentful less of a bitch it occurred to me as i listened that these women were describing infidelity not as a transgression but a creative or even subversive act a protest against an institution theyd come to experience as suffocating or oppressive
in an earlier generation this might have taken the form of separation or divorce but now it seemed more and more women were unwilling to abandon the marriages and families theyd built over years or decades they were also unwilling to bear the stigma of a publicly open marriage or to go through the effort of negotiating such a complex arrangement
these women were turning to infidelity not as a way to explode a marriage but as a way to stay in it whereas conventional narratives of female infidelity so often posit the unfaithful woman as a passive party the women i talked to seemed in control of their own transgressions there seemed to be something new about this approach
in the secret life of the cheating wife power pragmatism and pleasure in womens infidelity another book on infidelity to be published this november the sociologist alicia walker elaborates on the concept of female infidelity as a subversion of traditional gender roles
to do so she interviews 40 women who sought or participated in extramarital relationships through the ashley madison dating site
like the state of affairs walkers text offers valuable insight simply by way of approaching its subject from a position of curiosity as opposed to prevention or recovery and she investigates which factors led the women in her study to go outside their marriages
surely one might think a woman who would do such a thing must be acting out of a desire to escape a miserable marriage and yet it turns out this isnt always the case many of the women walker interviewed were in marriages that were functional like the women i knew who cheated many of the interviewees said they liked their husbands well enough they had property together they had friendships together they had children that they were working together to raise
but at the same time they found married life incredibly dull and constraining and resented the fact that as women they felt they consistently did a disproportionate amount of the invisible labor that went into maintaining their lifestyle
one woman in walkers book told her the inequality of it all is such an annoying factor that i am usually in a bad mood when my spouse is in my presence and another said that while her husband was a competent adult in the world at home he felt like another child to clean up after
many of the friends i spoke to expressed similar feelings i shop and cook my husband does dishes and empties the trash one told me we each do our own laundry but ive always been in charge of the calendar and what i didnt realize until recently is that in some way im in charge of managing many of our relationships
my husband is a homebody and i initiateplan almost all of our social endeavors my mom got this phrase from her therapist keeping the pulse of the household this idea that someone has to be managing the emotional heart of your tiny community i think women do that a lot
and as perel repeats frequently in this book and in her previous one little does as much to muffle erotic desire as this kind of caretaking and enmeshment
i think theres an incredible amount of deep resentment for women in america about divisions of labor said sociologist lisa wade when i asked her to comment on this contradiction and what social scientists are finding now is that there is a correlation between equal division of labor and better sex
no matter how much attention is paid to these issues she told me these kind of cultural beliefs hang on a long time after theyre relevant they hang on in ways that are often invisible a lot of women have tried to address these problems and have faced a lot of stubbornness from husbands they feel theres no way to win this battle so maybe now what women are deciding is that infidelity is a third way
of course its a third way that is not feasible for everyone even if more women are taking it up usually women who feel financially secure and independent enough to risk potential fallout these women seem to be finding that no amount of sensitivity or goodwill on the part of their husbands can save them from the fact that in every arena from work to marriage to parenthood theyre always doing more for less
as wade put it its such a precarious balance keeping everyone happy that for many women to start a long conversation about her own sexual satisfaction seems like a bad idea we now tell women that they can have it all that they can work and have a family and deserve to be sexually satisfied and then when having it all is miserable and overwhelming or they realize marriage isnt all its cracked it up to be maybe having affairs is the new plan b
i tested this idea out on a few of the friends who had confided in me about their affairs and most of them agreed twenty or thirty years ago they might have opted for divorce because surely there was another man out there who could do better in this role who could satisfy them completely but a lot of these women are children of divorce they lived through the difficulties divorce can create
even now all these years later one told me do you know what my most vivid memory of christmas is driving through a blizzard up i95 in the back of one of their cars and then theyd pull over on the side of the highway and hand off me and my brother without speaking that was our christmas why did these people marry in the first place
maybe thats the essential question the question preceding those perel explores in her book why do women still marry when if statistics are to be believed marriage doesnt make them very happy
i confided in a friend once that after 15 years of marriage the institution and the relationship itself continued to mystify me at the time i married marriage had felt like a panacea it was a bond that would provide security love friendship stability and romance the chance to have children and nice dishes to be introduced as someones wife it promised to expand my circle of family and improve my credit score to tether me to something wholesome and give my life meaning
could any single relationship not fall short of such expectations maybe these women were on to something valuing their marriages for the things it could offer and outsourcing the rest accepting the distance between the idealization and the actual thing seeing marriage clearly for what it is and not what were all told and promised it will be
join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter
my friend told me she felt this way of thinking was the only answer and the way shed come to reconcile her feelings about the relationship she said that she used to compare her marriage to her parents who always seemed totally in love until the end of my moms life they were spooning together every night in a double bed not even a queen but she added they were awful and narcissistic with very little to give to their children
my friend felt she and her husband were much better parents more involved and attuned to their kids
but often she went on it can feel like my husband and i are running a family corporation together and that our emotional intimacy consists of gossiping about our friends and watching game of thrones sometimes i wonder if when the kids leave i should either a have a passionate affair or b find another husband i may do neither but it seems like a is more likely than b i dont have any illusions that marrying someone else will make me happy not anymore"

"__label__fake coaching staff failing ravens
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
first quarter status report
remember when you were in grade school and you got progress reports they werent report cards so the letter grades werent written in ink so to speak but if you were trending in that d or f direction this was a wakeup call to get your sh together
well four games into the season the ravens are trending in the not passing direction
yes the team is 22 but they seem miles away from that team that was driving for a td score before the end of the first half against cleveland
we all know the story by now the potential nails in the coffin could have been losing marshal yanda and brandon williams against the browns and brent urban against the jaguars and that could very well be all there is to this teams putrid play the rest of the way against the jaguars and in week 4 against steelers
however there are other teams finding ways to win without having their best out there see kansas city and green bay coaching can mask some of the personnel issues that creep up for example with both of their starting offensive tackles out the green bay coaches shortened aaron rodgers drop steps used more readpass options rpos to get the ball out quick and used chips to slow down the outside rushers theyve faced
the ravens could have easily lost to jacksonville and pittsburgh with yanda williams and urban but to get embarrassed and lose by a combined score of 7016
nope thats where coaching has to be called into question
this passing game is designed the same way as last year we still see two and threeyard completions in thirdandlong situations we still see empty formations when the offense needs two or three yards to get a first down in a thirdandshort we still no use of trips stacks or bunches anything to create unbalanced looks to create oneonone mismatch opportunities against a defense ive been asking for these formations for years in my battle plans articles as i see how well they work around the league alas they remain nowhere to be found in baltimore
i get it marty mornhinweg has very little to work with from a talent standpoint the cupboard which was bare coming into the season got smashed into pieces when offensive linemen started dropping like flies thats no excuse for not at least attempting some different schematic approaches at the very least by the way im not holding my breath that anything will change
on defense injuries to the front seven can be an excuse when you havent invested so heavily in that front seven this group needs to be more consistent period theyve been shoved around the past two games
another observation over the first four games is that safety tony jefferson doesnt look like a good fit in this defense is it really that much of a surprise considering this is a dean pees defense jefferson thrived in arizona when he was in attack mode playing a glorified linebacker role he was used on thirddown blitzes he was a key cog in the run game
so far hes been underwhelming as a tackler and as an intimidator in coverage hes been lost in space
heres a thought maybe pees can experiment with jefferson as a primary box defender against oakland on early downs this coming sunday play more cover one with eric weddle as the centerfielder get jefferson going as an attacker again because right now hes not living up to his 34 million price tag
its just the latest example of the coaching staff failing to properly utilize the talent the front office provides them
what needs to improve
where to begin theres no way we can cover it all in this short article but lets scrape the surface
for starters the ravens need to get back to basics and continue to build off their ground attack theres still some promise with this run game some of the plays and designs that greg roman has brought to the table have hit the mark in the first quarter of the season
in particular the misdirection sweeps from shotgun have been highly effective if alex collins can stop putting the ball on the ground which to this point theres no reason to think will happen these plays have the juice to be home run hitters
in an offense this anemic they need to keep going to that well
defensively pees needs to let the young guys play more tim williams more tyus bowser start patrick onwuasor over kamalei correa
will they make mistakes sure but whats the point of less talented players seeing the field and making the same mistakes
theres a lot more ground to cover but this is a start
weve got three more progress reports to go this season heres to the midpoint progress report showing some actual you knowprogress

mexico city reuters the first man in modern mexican history to win a gubernatorial election as an independent said on wednesday he aimed to run in the 2018 presidential election putting pressure on the leading antiestablishment contender andres manuel lopez obrador
jaime rodriguez ruptured the political status quo by capturing the wealthy northern state of nuevo leon by a landslide in 2015 after he broke with president enrique pena nietos institutional revolutionary party or pri
rodriguez adds to a fragmented landscape of contenders led by twice presidential runnerup lopez obrador a former mexico city mayor who has spent years pitching himself as the only solution to ongoing political corruption and chronic inequality
i want to give it a try and i want to show that the people are tired of political parties and the politicians themselves rodriguez 59 told mexican broadcaster radio formula
known as el bronco due to his blunt style rodriguez has trailed far behind lopez obrador in early opinion polls
however his entry into the race could eat away at antiestablishment support for lopez obrador a leftist with nationalist leanings that in turn could help the pri
the avid horseman said he planned to register on saturday and will have four months to gather 866593 signatures or one percent of the electorate in at least 17 regions of mexico to qualify as an independent ahead of the july 2018 vote
voter surveys show all presidential hopefuls struggling to win the backing of as much as one third of the electorate

in june the pri was able to exploit those divisions winning a tight gubernatorial race in the state of mexico the countrys most populous region with barely a third of the vote

"__label__real cnn tropical storm nate moved across northeastern nicaragua on thursday en route to honduras as early forecast models showed it taking aim this weekend at the central us gulf coast likely as a minor hurricane according to the national hurricane center 
nates forecast track had shifted slightly by late thursday morning putting new orleans and its compromised drainage system directly in the storms sights with landfall predicted midmorning sunday along the louisiana coast as a hurricane residents across southeastern louisiana mississippi and alabama were expected to feel the storms fury this columbus day weekend cnn meteorologists said
the forecast cone also covered a small sliver of the florida panhandle where officials still reeling from hurricane irma enacted emergency plans
a tropical storm warning has been issued for the yucatan peninsula from punta herrero to rio lagartos mexico httpstcotw4kegdbfb nate pictwittercomlq9ih6tvsv
nicaragua and honduras at risk
nates maximum sustained winds had increased by thursday to 40 mph with the storm forecast to remain close to that intensity all day as it moved inland over nicaragua and honduras forecasters said
lifethreatening flash flooding and mudslides were possible in the central american nations with extreme rainfall totals of 15 to 20 inches possible in nicaragua and up to 8 inches predicted for honduras a tropical storm warning was in effect from sandy bay sirpi nicaragua to punta castilla honduras and from punta herrero to rio lagartos mexico the hurricane center said
after crossing over central america nate was expected to move back into the warm waters of the western caribbean cnn forecasters said there the storm could strengthen and experience an increase in forward speed though the yucatan peninsula could inhibit its growth
rapid intensification possible
some forecast models had predicted nate would become a much stronger hurricane and make landfall on the florida panhandle but those models now have fallen more in line with predictions of a landfall along the central gulf coast cnn meteorologist brandon miller said
still many factors will play a role in nates development through the weekend he said
how much nate is able to strengthen once it hits those warm waters depends a lot on how intact the center of the storm can maintain as it traverses land miller said if it gets ragged it will take some time to reform over the ocean and that will mean less time to gain in intensity
but if it manages to stay together while over central america it will be able to take advantage of those warm waters and quickly strengthen maybe even undergo rapid intensification he said
rapid intensification occurs when a storms maximum sustained winds increase at least 35 mph in 24 hours or less hurricanes harvey irma jose and maria all underwent the phenomenon on their way to becoming major hurricanes earlier this season
new orleans vulnerable to flooding
new orleans mayor mitch landrieu met thursday morning with local state and federal officials including representatives of the us army corps of engineers and louisiana national guard to discuss preparations for the possibility of hurricane conditions his spokeswoman said
the briefing came as the citys unique drainage system continued to experience critical deficiencies exposed during heavy august rainstorms that led to the flooding of several hundred properties
of new orleans 120 drainage pumps a dozen including three major pumps were out of service thursday morning for repairs or maintenance according to the most recent records posted online by the cityowned sewerage water board
one major pump that remained offline was located at the citys largestcapacity pump station in the lakeview neighborhood it serves a heavily populated swath along the citys western edge and a large section of neighboring jefferson parish another major pump in nearby city park was out of service the third was across the mississippi river in an area known as algiers
the other pumps that werent working were relatively small and included some that operate constantly to clear streets of runoff from daily usage records show
the water board also had backup generators at all 24 of its major pump stations including 11 temporary generators records show those generators were installed recently after one of five turbines that help power the citys oldest most powerful pumps failed exposing a lack of backup power at many locations three turbines were available for service thursday a water board spokeswoman told cnn
outside the bullseye florida still prepares
though nates forecast track late thursday morning only included a small patch of the western edge of the florida panhandle gov rick scott activated the highest level of his states emergency response plan he also encouraged residents to get prepared and stay alert in case the track changes and evacuations become necessary
just think about your family get your three days of water three days of food if youre taking medicine make sure you have your medicine he said during a morning news conference
with some parts of florida still reeling from hurricane irma scott warned residents not to become complacent
take these things seriously he said in the middle of a storm you cannot be evacuated so if theres an evacuation notice follow the evacuation notice and make sure you take these things seriously
a relentless hurricane season
nate takes aim in the waning days of the peak period of a hurricane season that has ravaged the united states the caribbean
though the season lasts from june 1 to november 30 storm activity hits its statistical peak on september 10 with the eight weeks surrounding that date considered a season within a season according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration
peak of hurricane season in the atlantic
during this time key environmental factors including higher ocean temperatures and reduced wind shear often align to fuel especially powerful storms
owing in part to those factors hurricanes this year have left catastrophe in their wake harvey caused historic flooding in houston irma devastated the florida keys katia triggered deadly mudslides in mexico and maria left puerto rico and nearby islands in ruins"

"__label__real washington cnn former vice president joe biden is recruiting friends into toughtowin southern races campaigning with democrats in virginia and new jersey and wading into superior court races in pennsylvania
he has cast president donald trump as racist told an lgbt crowd that we have a hell of a lot of work to do and tweeted at trump that this has to stop
once again we are living through a battle for the soul of the nation a battle i thought was done and won biden said in late september in south carolina
its all led to questions about whether biden who bypassed a presidential campaign in 2016 will seek the democratic nomination in 2020
increasingly democrats have looked to a wide field of younger figures to lead its antitrump message and tactics but among the partys elders with national stature biden has been much more of a presence on the campaign trail than former presidents barack obama and bill clinton and the 2016 democratic nominee hillary clinton and a much more direct critic of trump particularly on foreign policy
biden is set to campaign for the democratic candidates in this years two governors races thursday for phil murphy in new jersey then saturday for ralph northam in virginia
hes a soughtafter surrogate for democrats in the south biden recently visited alabama to help democrat doug jones launch his senate campaign against controversial former judge roy moore ahead of a december special election he also campaigned for archie parnell in a south carolina congressional special election
biden also has endorsed candidates in five targeted virginia delegate races one state senate special election in washington that would flip control of the chamber one successful state senate campaign in florida and a number of judges in pennsylvania
and he is crossing party lines biden is set to award arizona sen john mccain with the national constitution centers liberty medal next week in philadelphia the next day hell join ohio gov john kasich for a discussion about bipartisanship in delaware both republicans have been sharp critics of trump and have called for more bipartisan cooperation making them natural allies of biden who has decried washingtons partisanship
its too early to tell though whether bidens packed political calendar means hes considering a third presidential campaign in 2020 people close to him said
biden is deeply concerned with the direction of the country under trump and wants to have a voice in countering trump those people said but they cautioned he isnt yet personally giving serious consideration as he painstakingly did in the fall 2015 after the death of his son beau biden to whether he wants to run for president in 2020
we take it one day at a time bidens wife jill biden said while in charleston
biden is a political animal and his level of engagement isnt more than hes done in the past said former sen ted kaufman a close friend and adviser who was bidens chief of staff in his senate office for 19 years
pick a year at random over the last what is it now 40some years and youll find him involved in appearing for candidate fundraising events talking to people about whether they want to run those kinds of things kaufman said frankly this is way too early to start thinking about what youre going to be doing whether hell run for president or anything like that
bidens postvice presidential footprint
these days biden works for both the university of pennsylvania and the university of delaware heading a center and an institute bearing his name at each university he is also continuing his work on cancer research and preparing to roll out a new book
he is also traveling for speeches on other issues hell be at rutgers university on thursday for a discussion about sexual assault on college campuses one that comes a day after he sharply criticized harvey weinstein the hollywood executive producer and democratic megadonor at the antiviolence project courage awards in new york city
my father taught me that the greatest sin was the abuse of power mental physical or economic biden said there in his first comments about weinstein since reports of his history of his sexual assaults emerged six days earlier the cardinal sin was for a man to use his power to abuse a woman or a child it is disgusting but because of the bravery of so many courageous women speaking up putting their careers at risk to save other women from similar abuse this disgusting behavior at least on the part of harvey weinstein has been brought to an abrupt and justifiable end
is the big postvice presidential footprint a tea leaf to read in terms of bidens own political future not really kaufman said
its hard to tell people this but hes concerned about these issues kaufman said hes concerned about violence against women hes concerned about our foreign policy hes concerned about the middle class hes concerned about these things
on political matters the inner circle that speaks to biden nearly every day includes former chief of staff steve ricchetti now the managing director at penns biden center longtime adviser mike donilon greg schultz a former aide now heading up bidens american possibilities political action committee and kate bedingfield who was bidens communications director in his vice presidential office his sister valerie biden owens is also involved in his daytoday political activities
taking on trump in south carolina
at recent political events biden has raised local democrats eyebrows and stoked chatter about 2020 with his aggressive criticism of trumps presidency
biden who has deep democratic ties in south carolina a state that would serve as a linchpin in any potential run made his second visit to the state of 2017 in late september for a charleston naacp speech he also headlined a charleston county democratic party fundraiser prior to the naacp event and spoke with big donors and party operatives
we saw the truth of this president when he pardoned joe arpaio of arizona biden said during his remarks at the naacp dinner its moments like these that each of us has to stand up and declare with conviction and moral clarity that the klan white supremacists neonazis will never be allowed to march in the main street of american life that we will not watch this behavior and go numb when it happens
at the dinner which took place inside a ballroom a mere two blocks from the mother emanuel church where a white supremacists shot and killed nine africanamericans in 2015 he called out trumps response to the ku klux klan rallies in charlottesville virginia and said that americans have a duty to not tolerate this kind of intolerance
this is a moment for this nation to declare what this president cant with any clarity consistency or vision there is no place in america for hate groups
this just felt different a democratic operative in south carolina who was in attendance for the speech said he was more outspoken than ive honestly ever seen him and also i think hes i think the embarrassment and the anger over what trump is doing while in the white house he feels it personally i think having been in the white house for eight years he knows all that can happen good or bad he feels some sense of duty
i heard from numerous people that they were in awe of the stance he took and the energy he had and the remarks that he made specifically at the dinner said amanda loveday the former state democratic party executive director i got one text from a huge hillary clinton supporter saying that he was on fire he definitely came down here and provided an outlook for democrats on what could be next
longlasting south carolina ties
the former vice president isnt a stranger in the palmetto state former charleston mayor joe riley who held the job for 40 years withheld his endorsement of hillary clinton in 2016 until he was sure biden wouldnt run and dick harpootlian a former state party chair is a close ally who tried to persuade biden to run in 2016
biden was in south carolina earlier this year for the unveiling of a statue of former sen fritz hollings whom he credited with convincing him to take office at age 29 after his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash and with arranging for bidens swearingin at the hospital where his sons were at the time
then there is bidens relationship with another senator
the first time i took notice of him in south carolina was when he delivered the eulogy of republican sen strom thurmond said 2015 draft biden cochair inez tenenbaum who was south carolinas state education superintendent at the time his eulogy was remarkable and extraordinary and people felt such a connection with him at times thats how it all began
bidens upcoming events with kasich and for mccain are other examples of the former vice president crossing party lines
democrats and republicans alike are fans of joe biden south carolina state rep justin bamberg said he is very very likeable south carolinians are old school its all about who you know down here and he knows a lot of people and a lot of people know and respect him for his good reputation
the draft biden group was established in 2015 to get started on the ground should biden decide to run many south carolina democrats joined in and played active roles several elected officials endorsed biden even though he didnt run and loveday said that proves what could happen if he were to get into the 2020 race
another south carolina democrat state rep james smith became close with biden back in 2009 because both he and beau served overseas in the military during overlapping time periods
smith who last week announced he is running for governor was a draft biden leader in 2015 and has urged the former vice president to run in 2020 but their friendship goes deeper than that a source familiar with their relationship said biden was looking for elected officials who served overseas to correspond with beau was about to deploy to iraq he was put in touch with smith recently returned from a tour of duty in afghanistan the two began speaking on the phone regularly and are still in touch biden urged smith to run for governor
in an extensive interview with the charleston post and courier biden said he is behind smith
i have met a lot of guys in my career but this is a guy i swear to god that i would trust with anything this is a guy who i watched he never puts himself before anybody else biden said of smith
many operatives say a james smith campaign in 2018 could help build lists and an organizing structure that could be turned over to bidens camp in preparation for 2020
reasons for skepticism
if biden were to run in 2020 biden would still likely face a packed primary field and wouldnt have even south carolina locked down
bryanta maxwell the president of the young democrats in south carolina said her group has been getting excited for 2020 and throwing around names of people they hope will make a run at taking down trump
kamala harris of course maxine waters name has floated a bit cory booker elizabeth warren those are the main names that ive been hearing in my circles she said
obama brought something different to the table he brought diversity with him being an africanamerican male who grew up in a single family household and had to rise from the bottom to the top a lot of young people these days relate to that story more so than they do with an old white man if we have another candidate who can bring the excitement like that it could turn things around maxwell said
one critical factor is bidens age he is 74 and would be 77 on election day 2020
another factor is that he has run for president twice before and both times he fell short of the democratic nomination
bidens calls for bipartisanship and a past that includes eulogizing thurmond could also make him a poor match for an angry democratic primary electorate seeking a fierce trump critic
the good news for biden is that he had a very strong national network when he ran in 1988 and those people have been loyal to him ever since one national democratic strategist said the problem for biden in 2008 was that he didnt really expand that network he ran a campaign that time that was basically the same folks 20 years later
his challenge is not finding old friends to do events with the democrat said his challenge is finding new ones"
"__label__real cnn the blitz began early on tuesday morning at 613 am et a jab at the nfl five minutes later democrats are in the barrel they dont care about safety for usa there followed a pledge to use the power of the pen to give great healthcare to many people fast but first its 642 am now its on to jemele hill the espn reporter
with hill at the mike president donald trump tweets it is no wonder espn ratings have tanked break for 90 minutes then plug a book about himself then back to liddle bob corker who was made to sound a fool by the new york times thats what i am dealing with
as we approach the first anniversary of his election trump frustrated by a stalled political agenda has juiced up his rhetoric imposing himself his views his voice those tweets into almost every aspect of american life at an unnerving speed for less powerful groups the degree of disquiet created by trump is less alien but even more pervasive and comes with fewer opportunities to simply switch off
over the course of a little more than 48 hours last weekend beginning at 705 am on saturday trump tweeted 21 times one of his own posts from 804 am was retweeted by trump before the end of the day
that onslaught began on a bright note i finally got a good story in the washingtonpost he cooed early in the morning but the good feelings quickly turned sour as trump began to agitate for equal time to argue with a critical unfunny late night host then came word he dialed up democratic minority leader chuck schumer to discuss obamacare then another shot at the media then a shoutout to fema then at 331 pm a boost for his interview that night with mike huckabee

"__label__fake the durham bulls in 2017 part 2 the pitchers
before its news
42 different ballplayers pitched for the durham bulls this year up from 34 in 2016 and that was in the regular season add a couple more for the postseason run
of those 42 3 were position players thrown to the wolves at the end of losing contests catcher michael mckenry 3 times for 2 innings and an era of 5850 outfielder johnny field 1⅓ innings era 2025 and infielder kean wong ⅓ inning era 000
13 of those 42 had less than 10 innings and were a mixture of rehabbing tb pitchers eg brad boxberger and shortterm promotions from aa montgomery
here are a few charts to get us started beginning with the number of innings pitched
click on chart for larger image
then heres a look at the eras earned run averages and fips fielding independent percentages
walks and hits per inning pitched whip
and lastly a homegrown measure of efficiency pitches per out
note we had a discussion like this last year and players mention then are marked with a that links to that blog post for a complete roster check this link list below is sorted by innings pitched players on 40man marked with an asterisk inside the perens handedness appearances innings wonloss holds h blown saves bs saves s
ryan yarbrough lefthanded 26 appearances 1571 innings 136 was the obvious star of the durham bulls starters the most wins the most starts most innings 3rd best era after chirinos and snell he had three starts in the postseason and the bulls won all three games although he only got credit for one win he came to the rays system out of the seattle system at just 25 he should have a big future with the rays hes not on the 40man and has no major league time so the bulls might see him back next year stats
yonny chirinos r 23 141 125 came up from montgomery in early may and never looked back at 23 years old he should also have a huge future with the rays and the bulls in 23 games he had the best era of the regular starting crew see blake snell for the exception the 2nd best efficiency rating and the best whip among the starters a superb 098 plus as with yarbrough hes not on the 40man so we could see him again next year in the postseason he had a win in 2 starts and only gave up one run in 10 innings lastly great fun to watch stats
brent honeywell r 24 1232 128 came up from montgomery in midapril so essentially spent all 2017 with the bulls in his 24 starts his era was just slightly worse 364 than yarbrough certainly more than respectable hes also young just 24 his whip of 130 is above the team average and he works pretty hard for his outs 556 po however in the case of a named prospect youre never sure if they start each game with an instruction to work on something which in turn skews their stats a bit stats
andrew kittredge r 41 681 51 8h 2bs 2s put in a bunch of innings as a reliever in a bunch of games in fact he and adam kolarek were tied for 2nd place in that category he carried a stunning era of just 145 a whip of 095 and was extremely efficient at 489 pitches per out he has had 13 innings with the rays this year so far he was called up for the third time in early september he was a key figure in the superb bulls bullpen by the way he started 2 games as part of the bulls several bullpen days stats
jeff ames r 46 631 11 4h 2s has numbers that in my view understate his importance to the bulls this year his era of 398 wasnt stellar nor was his whip of 1405 and he certainly wasnt very efficient at 603 pitches per out on the other hand he was always there ready to put in an inning or two at just about any point in a game he appeared in five postseason games and did not allow a run and stranded 4 inherited baserunners im not sure the bulls would have made it to or through the championships without him stats
chihwei hu r 31 602 41 4h 1s was yet another solid member of the relief team he began the year as the bulls 2 starting pitcher jacob faria was 1 but in midapril the rays called him up and decided that he was to be a relief pitcher and that was his role both at tampa bay and with the bulls for the rest of the year he endured a lot of back and forth by my count he was back and forth four times during the bulls season and he went back up after the bulls finished their postseason very good overall performance era 306 whip 115 po 531 at a guess he may firm up his role with the rays this month and into the spring he made three appearances in the postseason the bulls won two of those three games stats 
jake faria r 11 582 61 jake faria started the season as jacob was the opening day starting pitcher for the durham bulls and went on to do a terrific job all of april and may he was called up by tampa bay and went into their rotation until going on the disabled list in august he was back as a reliever in midseptember unlikely to be back as a durham bull good luck stats 
hunter wood r 19 531 21 5h did not join the bulls until midjune coming up from montgomery he initially went into the starting rotation and did just fine in late july however he was moved to the bullpen for 13 more appearances overall the young 23 years old seems to need more work but he sure made a difference in his three short postseason stints two wins ive heard he has a high upside in the organization and that makes sense his era 439 fip 457 and whip 139 are not particularly impressive but its a small sample size he took an interesting path to the bulls he started the year in montgomery went up to tampa bay for his major league debut at the end of may went back to montgomery for 3 games then came to the bulls next year probably stats
ryne stanek r 36 442 30 4h 8s is an exciting ballplayer to watch when hes in town in addition to his 36 appearances with the bulls he made 19 with the rays and was with them at the end of the season stanek has been groomed as a closer with his 100 mph fastball a fellow razorback even though theres a 50year difference in our attendance dates he is eventually going to stick with the rays or another club as a bull his numbers were exceptional era 121 fip 159 and whip 090 the best on the team among those with any significant amount of innings stats 
michael roth l 10 441 24 1h came to the bulls out of the giants system and sacremento in the pacific coast league he did not have an auspicious beginning losing his first three starts things were looking better in the next two but after that not much to cap it off he left the august 24th game with what was reported to be a broken finger and has not been heard from since pretty dismal stats era 508 fip 548 whip 138 at 27 this might have been his last chance but then there were those two really good games and hes lefthanded stats
blake snell l 7 44 50 came back to durham for a 7game visit in may and june did a terrific job and went back to the rays where he has mostly struggled whatever is a problem for him when he wears a rays uniform doesnt show up when hes in bulls gear he won 5 games and the bulls won in another start his game score stat was above average in all but one of his starts solid era of 266 slightly weak for a major leaguer whip of 132 and he did give up 5 home runs nevertheless he helped the bulls a lot in a championship season stats 
neil wagner r 32 44 01 4h 1bs 3s was doing a fine job for the bulls this year up to the allstar break after that its hard to say what happened at a guess at 33 and the oldest pitcher on the team he became the odd man out even though he seemed to have made a solid comeback from his surgery he was subject to a bit of back and forth with hudson valley getting in just a partial inning on july 26 before his release he was immediately signed by the mets and assigned to their las vegas aaa franchise as a bull he was an asset with decent stats over his 44 innings era307 whip116 as a las vegas 51er he was superb 8 games 10 innings era of 000 whip of 077 so looks like he landed on his feet stats 
adam kolarek l 41 432 34 11h 4bs 3s is a puzzle to me he came out of the mets system and was the rare lefty in last years bullpen he got his callup to the rays in late june stayed for july spent august with the bulls and made a brief visit back with the rays in september as a bull he was a real asset his odd semisidearm delivery seemed to be hard to handle no home runs he came into the game in difficult situations he inherited 17 runners the most of any bulls reliever only six of those runners scored terrific era 165 decent whip 115 after his return from tampa bay it sure seemed like they were looking at him to be a loogy lefthanded one out guy and that seemed to be his role in the playoffs where he had 4 appearances and did a fine job he was not on the 40man at the end of the year so hard to tell the future of this 28 yearold stats 
diego castillo r 30 422 32 5h 1bs 7s made a tremendous difference from the day he arrived up from montgomery the beginning of june even after his numbers got hammered after a disastrous game on the 6th of july 6 runs without an out that blew up his era to 529 he stayed the course and ended the year with a decent era of 338 an even better fip of 222 a whip of 115 and a very efficient po of 498 the best parts of his performance were the 7 saves 6 of them coming after the allstar break and then there was his work in the playoffs 5 appearances and 3 saves just brilliant plus theres a good chance the 23 yearold will be back with durham next year stats
ryan garton r 24 33 20 3h 4s grew up in the rays system and did a decent job this year but got traded off to the seattle mariners he was up and back to the rays a couple of times and spent some time on the dl but his numbers as a bull were superb an era of 164 and a whip of 094 he was part of a trade that included catcher mike marjama yet another example of the rays being unableunwilling to develop young catchers in return the rays got a pitcher anthony misiewicz and an infielder luis rengifo misiewicz had 5 starts in montgomery rengifo played in 23 games for the bowling green hot rods garton has had 10 appearances with the mariners marjama had a short callup to the mariners and played 21 games with their aaa franchise in tacoma stats 
austin pruitt r 9 242 00 2h 1s put in two rehabish stints with the bulls and was helpful while here nice to see pruitt in the majors stats 
yoel espinal r 12 222 21 1h had a very odd year he started with the charlotte stone crabs jumped to durham then to montgomery then back to durham and back to montgomery then down to the gulf coast rays and finally back where he started with the stone crabs a at a guess some potential stats
chaz roe r 17 22 04 5h 2bs 4s came over from the atlanta system in midjuly he did ok but took 4 losses and had two blown saves he was called up in september and has made 6 appearances in short relief with the rays stats
players with limited innings

came down from tampa bay near the end of the season then went back diego moreno r 11 161 00 1h 5s started the season with the bulls went to tampa bay in may never came back he first went on the 60day disabled list then was claimed off waivers by cleveland and ended up with the columbus clippers

"__label__fake redemption for ravens
before its news
the airwaves lit up this morning about joe flacco and his two long passes to receiver mike wallace in the ravens 3017 victory over the oakland raiders on sunday
however there was another firstquarter play that better defined flaccos bounceback game
flacco fell to the ground after running into left guard james hurst the 6foot6 245pound quarterback then picked himself off the grass dodged a couple of potential tacklers and completed a pass to jeremy maclin
the play perfectly underscored flaccos reaction to all of the criticism he faced over the past two weeks his offensive line also seemed to respond to his determination his blockers had their best game of the year by not allowing a sack and opened wide lanes for the running backs
flacco brushed off the recent bad press in his postgame comments however there was a sense of redemption in his voice
its part of being an nfl quarterback is dealing with tough times flacco said when you dont play well you own it and you go on to the next one i have confidence in who i am as a player and a person i have confidence in our football team im never going to waver i may not play well one week but its not going to change who i am and who i believe i am
flacco finished with modest numbers completing 19 of 26 passes for 222 yards he finished with a qb rating of 986 he did not throw an interception for the first time in 10 straight games
the ravens did catch a break when derek carr was ruled out with a back injury however no team in the nfl has dealt with more injuries than the ravens who have a leaguehigh 16 players on the ir
still it was a potentially seasonsaving win falling to 23 would have been a black hole for this team
flacco said earlier in the week that the offense lacked confidence his 52yard strike to wallace on the first play from scrimmage was the boost they needed and set the tone for the rest of the game
flacco was also helped by his running attack buck allen and alex collins combined for 128 yards and their fresh legs were key to closing out the game in the fourth quarter with pittsburghs stunning 309 loss to jacksonville the ravens are tied for first in the afc north
the ravens host the bears on sunday while pittsburgh has to travel to kansas city which is the only team that appears to be separating itself from the rest of the afc
while coach john harbaugh was clearly elated with the win he knows his team has a lot of work to do the defense is still allowing big runs without brandon williams in the lineup and the secondary allowed michael crabtree to catch a 41yard touchdown pass from ej manuel
for now though the ravens put some their some of their other struggles behind them their quarterback has regained some of his confidence a win over the bears would keep the newfound momentum rolling
we just have to figure out how to play the next game harbaugh said its a one week league if this doesnt show this and when you look around the nfl any fan in the nfl should know that by now its an every week league it can change every every every week is a different week and you just got to come out and find a way to play your best football and try to win your next game thats really what it is think in terms like that is valuable i think

"__label__fake the 2017 white sox season provided more positives than negatives
before its news
late sunday afternoon tim anderson grounded out to third base to end the 2017 chicago white sox season a season in which the teams future was decided before pitchers and catchers reported back in february the 2017 season was the beginning of a rebuild for the white sox and all those involved were dreading having to go through the death march that is a rebuilding noncompetitive season in the end it didnt feel that bad especially with the arrow pointing up for the white sox heading into 2018 with two major trades that sent quality talent elsewhere before the start of the season on april 3rd opening day could not have gotten off to a rockier start for the white sox and their fan base the original opening day was confusing as a good portion of the fans showed up and were only treated to player introductions before the game postponed due to rain the season would start the following day and saw jose quintana get roughed up in his first opening day start giving up five runs quintanas early season struggles worried fans as they feared his inconsistencies would hurt his trade value they were wrong as quintana would garner the biggest regular season acquisition for the white sox as he was traded to the crosstown chicago cubs on july 13th as the cubs sent back highly touted prospects in outfielder eloy jiminez and pitcher dylan cease during the first half of the white sox season fans were more interested the possibilities of trades for such white sox players as todd frazier melky cabrera david robertson tommy kahle and miguel gonzalez all of who were traded during the season general manager rick hahn did his best to get the highest value for each player with the league knowing that the white sox were looking to trade off assets already his most impressive trades actually received the lowest amount of attention as he traded relief pitcher anthony swarzak to the milwaukee brewers on july 25th in return for the brewers 13th ranked prospect outfielder ryan cordell two days later hahn traded another relief pitcher in dan jennings to the tampa bay rays in return for first baseman casey gillaspie who was named the rays 2016 minor league player of the year the second half of the season was exciting for a different reason as a good portion of the minor league talent the white sox had acquired in the offseason trades were called up to the majors to play the rest of the season the most exciting callup was for second baseman yoan moncada who was the main piece for the white sox in the chris sale trade in 53 games moncada drew 28 walks and finished with a slash line of 230335743 other prospects called up were pitchers lucas giolito reynaldo lopez and carson fulmer who all pitched well in the month of september recording quality starts in most of their outings it is also important to note the achievements of two of the remaining veterans for the white sox in first baseman jose abreu and outfielder avasil garcia abreu made history as he posted his fourth consecutive season with 25 home runs and over 100 rbis driven to start a career joining only albert pujols and joe dimaggio as the only players in major league history to do so garcia had a season no one saw coming as he finished third in the majors for batting average as he hit 330 on the season and made the allstar team for the first time he improved his batting average by 85 points and his on base percentage by 73 the white sox added to the rebuild during the season as they signed the mostsought after international talent in outfielder luis robert on may 27th robert is ranked third on the white sox top 30 prospects list and ranks 22nd on mlbs top 100 prospects list he is one of six white sox players on the top 100 list four of which rank in the top 50 of that list in 2016 the white sox had only two players rank on that list with none being in the top 50 of the list unlike the 201617 offseason the white sox will not have a lot of major league talent to trade for minor league prospects as the only veteran talent they will feature will be garcia and abreu hahn will look to sign midlevel free agents again with the hopes to flip them for prospects at the trade deadline just like did this season the team has the possibility to compete in 2018 or at least show signs of improvement from this season as their young talent will have another year of major league experience underneath their belt also prospects such as jiminez michael kopech alec hansen and zach collins have the possibility of making their major league debut in 2018 in a season that saw the white sox lose 95 games and obtain the fourth overall pick in next years amateur draft the season as a whole was more exciting than what it was initially expected to be the players on this seasons roster deserve a lot of recognition as they played hard and had fun as a team even with knowing what was expected all season long fans and the organization handled the first year of a rebuild as there were more positive vibes than negative vibes during the entirety of the season when the white sox are competitive once again the 2017 season will serve as a fond memory for all as it will be looked at as where it all began for the white sox future success

"__label__fake marty just harbaughs latest victim
 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
ravens fans i think we need to have a serious conversation about coordinators in baltimore and a pattern that has befallen on them a pattern that that is so specific and dismal that i am fully convinced this is not a coincidental occurrence on a yearly basis but a plague whose epicenter sits at the top of the coaching tree
unfortunately it appears that ravens offensive coordinator marty mornhinweg is the most recently infected member of the organization
this plague has a few noticeable symptoms that allow us to make an early diagnosis of the infection
it starts with a very gradual change in philosophies when a coach comes to baltimore with plenty of chatter around committing to the run we begin to question the symptoms its not until we see that alleged commitment has been completely abandoned do we truly think we have an infectious case
in the curious case of mornhinweg he came into this season with a propensity to throw the ball heavily based on 2016 then reverted in the first few weeks to running the ball just as the team had committed to during the offseason seeing his recent change in philosophy back to throwing an ungodly amount in the past few weeks has me convinced hes already infected and will continue to stumble down a path of no return
the next symptom we like to call nonanswers in which the victims of this infection start to speak in circles and answer every question with a bunch of sentences strung together that equate to absolutely nothing contextual or even a cognizant response to the question at hand you see similar symptoms in politicians lawyers and nfl commissioners
back to our poor sickly marty he has been speaking in nonanswers for the better part of this season but only sporadically it wasnt until yesterday that he truly began to exhibit advanced symptoms during his time at the podium when pressed about the teams offensive woes
heres marty on the lack of time for flacco in the pocket
we all have to do a little bit better on the thing and those things will happen i know this ive been through this thing before if you keep working hard and keep preparing good things will happen good things they always tend to happen that confidence thing alltime high
and heres marty flat out avoiding talking about the play of austin howard so far this season when asked about it
were happy to have him hes going back to oakland you know he was with oakland i know its a big week for austin
one more for good record to show his nonanswer phase is in full effect marty mornhinweg when asked what specifically joe flacco is working on during practice to improve his game
there are a lot of specific things and that goes with every position more than a handful of plays the last ball game details it is really every position they are details and then you end up getting those four five six seven plays in a game that may make a difference
of course this is only a snippet but 3 questions 3 instances of marty completely avoiding the question with a nonanswer
i dont see how this can be misconstrued in any way at this point this is a clearcut indication that this plague has befallen marty and its only a matter of time until it takes over
there are two final phases of this plague that well unfortunately have to sit back and watch as they continue to progress in the muchmaligned ravens oc a phrase that has become commonplace in baltimore over the years
the first being full blown denial
as of now marty is sidestepping the truth but in due time hell flat out lie and deny it hell begin to use phrases like joe is a great quarterback its just been outside factors or this offensive line doesnt get enough credit the fans and the media will see right through this facade knowing very well that hes boldfaced lying about the offense
regardless marty will continue to spew fallacies right and left until he runs out of synonyms for great and confident
eventually he may lash out at reporters much like weve seen from the man who i was patient zero in this plague upon the ravens john harbaugh
dont believe me on the source of the epidemic use logic here folks hes long shown all of the symptoms deception about committing to the run nonanswers full blown denial its all there and yet harbaugh doesnt seem to make it to the final phase of this epidemic sweeping over every ravens coach during his tenure he simply keeps on trucking handing off spores of infection to each and every coordinator who walks through those doors in an effort to dodge the end result
the final phase as many know from previous victims of this plague cam cameron marc trestman being the most recent victims is the pink death
it comes in the form of a slip and it immediately removes the infected victim from the franchise as the plague is ready to move on to its next victim
sometimes those infected by the pink slip go on to thrive and sometimes they fade into oblivion cameron made a name for himself as the offensive coordinator at lsu following his pink death coaching up the likes of odell beckham jr jarvis landry jeremy hill however the infection never fully left his system as cam only lasted until 2016 before getting the ax
jim caldwell remains as the head coach for the detroit lions and looks to be authoring an impressive turnaround in that franchises fortunes so far he is the only known patient to thrive following contraction of this disease
unfortunately for mornhinweg it appears hes likely to follow the path of those infected before him and succumb to the final stages of this infection believe me when i say all of baltimore wishes he could keep fighting this plague and turn things around but it appears the inevitable pink death is not far off
in my unprofessional opinion id give him 2 weeks
then its on to the next victim
keep your head on a swivel greg roman the harbaugh plague has its eye on you

"__label__real new delhi thomson reuters foundation a ruling by indias top court against husbands who have sex with their child brides will protect millions of girls and may propel efforts to make marital rape a crime in the conservative nation according to campaigners
indias supreme court on wednesday struck down a decadesold clause in the countrys rape laws permitting a man to have sex with his wife if she is aged between 15 to 18 ruling that it was rape and therefore a criminal offense
the age of consent in india is 18 years old and petitioners challenging the exemption in the countrys rape laws said it was in contradiction with other legislation
campaigners hailed the verdict as landmark adding that it was particularly significant as people across the world celebrated international day of the girl child
the judgment is a step forward in protecting girls from abuse and exploitation irrespective of their marital status said divya srinivasan from equality now which promotes the rights of women and girls
this positive decision by the supreme court will hopefully encourage the indian government to protect all women by removing the marital rape exemption in all cases
child marriage is illegal in india but it is deeply rooted and accepted in society and remains widespread in parts of the country the 2011 census shows more than 5 million girls were wed before the legal age of 18 a marginal decrease from 2001
along with niger guinea south sudan chad and burkina faso india is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of child marriage despite moves to empower girls and women and toughen penalties against the crime
poverty weak law enforcement patriarchal norms and concern about family honor are factors contributing to early marriage
but the practice violates child rights cutting across every part of womens development and creating a vicious cycle of malnutrition poor health and ignorance experts say
criminalizing marital rape
in its ruling on wednesday the twojudge bench said the exemption in the rape laws was unconstitutional and just because it was tradition this was not a reason for it to continue
exception in rape law is discriminatory capricious and arbitrary it violates bodily integrity of the girl child said the ruling if a man has sexual intercourse with a wife who is below 18 years it is an offense
womens rights campaigners hoped the ruling would encourage national debate in india about outlawing marital rape
marital rape is not a crime in india and prime minister narendra modis rightwing government believes criminalizing marital rape could destabilize marriages and make men vulnerable to harassment by their wives
the government said in august that it believed india should not blindly follow western countries that have criminalized marital rape as illiteracy and diversity make india unique
in india activists say it is hard for victims to speak out about sexual violence by their husbands as a result there are no accurate figures on marital rape
but more than 40 percent of married women aged 15 to 49 experience domestic violence according to government data rising to 70 percent among child brides
more than 50 countries including the united states nepal britain and south africa criminalize marital rape
this is a timely and positive step in the right direction for the discourse on marital rape and the subject of consent said poonam muttreja executive director of the population foundation of india
i would urge the courts to take cognizance of the predicament of adult women who live in fear of rape or sexual violence at the hands of their spouse and in the security of her home"
"__label__real fadi hakura is a turkey expert and associate fellow at chatham house the royal institute of international affairs an independent policy institute based in london the opinions expressed in this commentary are his
cnn the decision by the united states to suspend the processing of visas for turkish citizens following the arrest of a us consulate employee looks set to escalate if media reports that turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for another consular official turn out to be true
this deterioration of relations between the united states and turkey should come as no great surprise it follows a decline in friendliness that has gradually worsened over the last few years on a number of issues
turkish president recep tayyip erdogans requests for the us military to end its cooperation with the kurdistan workers partyaffiliated syrian kurdish fighters have fallen on deaf ears he has publicly berated the pentagon for supplying arms to a group seeking to establish an autonomous kurdish entity in northern syria along the turkishsyrian border
then there is the complex issue of us reluctance in ankaras eyes to extradite the pennsylvaniabased muslim cleric fethullah gulen who it alleges played a crucial role in the failed coup plot in june 2016 the us government justifies its position by retorting that turkey has failed to provide sufficient evidence of his involvement to initiate the legal process for extradition in american courts as required by the 1979 usturkey extradition treaty
the united states perceives turkeys detention of us pastor andrew brunson and willingness to swap him for gulen as unfair and illegal
interestingly erdogan is not relying on the extradition treaty but on powers he granted himself under emergency rule to exchange detained foreigners for turks imprisoned abroad
he is also angry at the united states for arresting a turkishiranian gold trader reza zarrab and issuing a criminal indictment against a former turkish minister mehmet zafer caglayan over allegedly bypassing us financial sanctions against iran by facilitating goldforoil trade via turkey
just watched who is fethullah gulen replay more videos must watch who is fethullah gulen 0356
in response to this decline in relations between the two allies turkey has purchased russias s400 missile system despite it being incompatible with nato systems and is coordinating syria policy closely with both moscow and tehran
however russia will not have forgotten that a turkish f16 fighter jet shot down a russian su24 near the turkishsyrian border not so long ago equally tehran will be well aware of erdogans onceunstoppable determination to dislodge its erstwhile friend syrian president bashar alassad
in other words russias and irans dalliance with turkey is purely transactional and short term only a few years ago turkey was coordinating its syria strategy with the united states in the forlorn hope of deepening us military intervention there once heightened expectations are frustrated erdogan tends to gyrate to the opposing camp out of anger and disappointment
given turkeys geostrategic position and historical partnership with the united states it should adopt a more flexible and sober approach that balances relations with washington and moscow by shifting between russia and the west turkey portrays itself unnecessarily as a volatile and challenging counterpart that image does turkey no favors in the turbulent middle east and undermines its reliability with friends and allies
moreover turkeys perennial dependence on huge external capital flows from western financial markets to fund its economic prosperity should be reason enough for it to reign in its recent disagreeability with the united states and european countries such as germany
after all the turkish economy will be significantly damaged if ankaras current foreign policy trajectory persists
ultimately erdogans fight with the united states is a loselose to both parties but probably more so in the longer term to turkey"

the clinching blow sunday occurred when odell beckham jr had to be carted off the field face in a towel with a fracture to his left ankle with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter on the next play the chargers melvin ingram sacked eli manning forced a fumble and recovered it on the 11yard line to set up los angeless goahead touchdown
a funereal silence enveloped metlife stadium which had remained upbeat as the giants 05 had threatened to pull away but never did it was replaced as the players left the field by fullthroated boos
one might say these are distressing times for a typically confident fan base it went through this before in 2013 when a bumbling giants team began 06 but the expectations were different this year within and without the locker room
there the shock anger even humiliation poured forth along with the confusion
this was a game we really needed cornerback eli apple said this was the one to let it slip through our fingers is definitely heartbreaking

the giants tried going back to basics during practice last week simplifying the calls homing in on the fundamentals even turning off the music that typically blares at points so that the players could better focus

on the teams final drive the giants had to use three tight ends to fill the vacancies
dwayne went down shep went down brandon went down odell went down offensive lineman justin pugh said its crazy ive never seen that before
the rash of injuries added to the feeling of this being a rare snakebitten year for one of the nfls models of consistency asked if he could apply any lessons learned from that 2013 season manning shook his head
theres not a secret formula to fix it manning said just got to play better
last week beckham had made a passing reference to a defensive back for the tampa bay buccaneers who he said seemed to know what plays the giants were running the suggestion was that coach ben mcadoo as the one who calls plays was too predictable
but the offense which entered sunday averaging 15 points per game tied for 30th in the league is only part of the giants problem the defense which was second in the nfl a season ago in points allowed had surrendered more points and more yards than 24 other teams punter brad wing has had underwhelming kicks in consecutive weeks and the kicker aldrick rosas missed a 43yard field goal in the fourth quarter of the teams loss to tampa bay
in other words there are a lot of problems
i think we showed a lot of fight out there mcadoo said but this is professional football weve got to go to work and find a way to win
the predictability comment by beckham could have stung mcadoo a former offensive coordinator who was hailed as a scoring guru when he was hired but last season the giants ran more than 90 percent of their plays with the same personnel grouping of three receivers one running back and one tight end
are defenses teeing up the team continues to lean heavily on that grouping while mcadoo deflected the buccaneers taunts as a nonissue yet for a team that boasts one of the leagues most dynamic players in beckham and recently invested 11 million in marshall and a firstround pick in a tight end evan engram the lack of offensive results remained perplexing
it has been a season with few answers for anything the giants thought they had a chance to be one of the teams competing for a super bowl now they are one of the three still without a win"

"__label__real paris reuters a french art expert believes a charcoal drawing kept in a collection for more than 150 years may be a preparatory sketch made by leonardo da vinci of the mona lisa
the blackandwhite drawing of a woman nude from the waist up known as the monna vanna was previously attributed to leonardos studio suggesting it was done in his style by a pupil or follower not by the master himself
but after preliminary tests at the louvre museum experts believe the sketch may well have been drawn by leonardo
among the signs according to curator mathieu deldicque are the fact the drawing was made during the same period as the mona lisa the paper is from the same region of italy and the technique is very similar to that of the mona lisa
we know the drawing was made during the lifetime of leonardo da vinci we know that the paper was made in italy between venice and florence and the third discovery is the high quality of this drawing in the face of the monna vanna and in her arms deldicque told reporters
thats very interesting because the arms are the same as the mona lisas
leonardo who lived from 1452 to 1519 was an engineer scientist inventor and sculptor as well as one of the finest artists of the italian renaissance
he painted the mona lisa also known as la gioconda and regarded as the worlds most valuable artwork at the beginning of the 16th century it is believed to depict lisa gherardini the wife of a successful merchant
exciting
the charcoal portrait in which the woman is holding a similar pose to the mona lisa but with her body more sideon and her head turned further over her left shoulder has been held in a collection at the conde museum at the palace of chantilly north of paris since 1862
the mona lisa and monna vanna hold their hands in very similar ways the right hand across the left and resting on the forearm the fingers gently extended
deldicque said that while it was exciting to think the charcoal drawing was created by leonardo there were more tests to be done
we have one more month of analysis and then a very slow process of history of art with a collection of analysts and advice by specialists he said
it is possible that process will determine that the authorship is the same but it may also be inconclusive he said adding maybe the mystery will remain"

the march toward a cashless society has now moved from the theoretical to the phase of widespread adoption this is primarily due to developments in the tech sector that now enable the easy use of biometric recognition systems as well as the increasing acceptance from a public who is becoming familiar with turning themselves into a password for their personal devices
behind the scenes governments and corporations have been building the political and economic enticements via the better than cash alliance to ensure that the world eventually gets decashed were now witnessing the full rollout of an architecture that has been in development for many years
chinas hightech kfc recently made headlines when it began testing facial recognition payments in its kpro store cashless agenda denialists however could readily point to chinas authoritarian government to ease any fears about an impending technocratic takeover occurring in the supposedly more democratic west
well todays cashless agenda news does come from the west and its a worlds first as reported by the telegraph londons costcutter supermarket has announced that its shoppers can now pay by finger vein scan
it works by using infrared to scan peoples finger veins and then links this unique biometric map to their bank cards customers bank details are then stored with payment provider worldpay in the same way you can store your card details when shopping online shoppers can then turn up to the supermarket with nothing on them but their own hands and use it to make payments in just three seconds
nice and convenient of course
longtime readers of activist post might remember an article by brandon turbeville written in 2011 warning that this was being tested as a future payment system remarking at the time about how smartphone payments would eventually seem outdated he explained
taking the cashless control grid one step further an article published on august 8 2011 in technology review entitled beyond cell phone wallets biometrics promise truly walletfree future explains that major corporations are not even waiting for the digital wallet to catch on they are actually moving forward with a system that will allow for an individual to swipe their palm not their phone in front of a digital recognition device in order to gain access to various buildings pay for merchandise or otherwise identify oneself indeed this new type of technology even this specific product is already being introduced all over the united states for instance new york universitys langone medical center has already implemented the vein scanners in some of its medical facilities manufactured by fujitsu the scanners are being placed in the hospital under the guise of greater convenience the marketing gift that keeps on giving and faster access to medical records health histories insurance forms and other documents are all handled electronically and at a much faster pace with the help of the new vein scanners schools too have begun to implement the fujitsu systems for instance the pinellas county school district in florida recently announced that it was introducing the system in order to identify students and thereby reduce waste and the threat of impersonation with the new scanners the students are able to have their meals deducted from their account upon scanning their palms as they march single file in the feeding lines during lunch time of course this type of technology is not new to pinellas county the students have been finger scanning in order to gain access to their lunch for years
naturally these days not everyone is worried only about the intrusive nature of turning ones body into a password to be mined by algorithms for corporations and governments but just as legitimately about having their financial data hacked
no worries says the developer of the newest form of vein scanning sthaler although company director simon binns manages to sound creepy and objectifying even while trying to reassure the veinscanning public
free stormproof waterproof survival match kit ad this is the safest form of biometrics there are no known incidences where this security has been breached when you put your finger in the scanner it checks you are alive it checks for a pulse it checks for haemoglobin your vein pattern is secure because it is kept on a database in an encrypted form as binary numbers no card details are stored with the retailer or ourselves it is held with worldpay in the same way it is when you buy online
system developers are projecting that adoption of the technology will be rapid with perhaps thousands of stores nightclubs and membership services getting on board in the near future the question is will it be optional and if so for how long
as brandon turbeville concluded more than 6 years ago
it should be noted that almost every element of any control grid begins by being optional when it is first introduced to the target population but as more and more individuals acquiesce to the system the more inconvenient and subsequently the harder it will become for the rest of us to opt out eventually the ability to opt out will be removed altogether

"__label__fake rams upset cowboys on the road
before its news
it was a tale of 2 halves the rams were clearly outplayed in the first half but despite the cowboys dropping 3 tds on the rams in the 2nd quarter the score going into halftime was only rams 16 cowboys 24 in the second half a different rams squad came onto the field in the second half the rams defense rose up and controlled the cowboys offense with a little more than 9 minutes remaining in the game the rams had scored 19 unanswered points the rams then got conservation right at the end of the 4th which could have been costly in the last 3 minutes they had a decision to play for the win or play it safe and settle for a fg they played it safe which in my book was the wrong call luckily the rams defense did their jobs and forced the cowboys to give up the ball on downs game over baby
main contributors in rams victory
1 special teams play pharoh cooper had 4 returns for a total of 123 yards good field position makes a difference in both moral and the pace of the game and kicker greg zuerlein had a record setting performance kicking 7 field goals in a single game 3 of those field goals were over 40 yards
2 the rams defense came up big in the 4th quarter ilb mark barron came up with a clutch interception keeping the cowboys from building momentum the rams defense put a lot of pressure on cowboys qb prescott and sacked him 3 times on the day
3 todd gurley and todd gurley why 2 todd gurleys because gurley had a major impact on both the running game and the receiving game on the ground he rushed 23 times for 121 yards in the air he went 7 for 94 and a wicked 53 yard td reception in the 3rd quarter
the rams continue to receive strong contributions from rookie wr cooper kupp who today chipped in another 5 receptions for 60 yards and a td
not only are the rams proving for the first time in many years they have a competent offense theyre also starting to show signs of character signs of a winning character todays victory gives us a 31 record and puts us at the top of the nfc west next week the rams go back home and take on the vulnerable seahawks that should be an exciting contest have a great week rams fans go rams

"__label__fake postgame snapshot jaguars 44 ravens 7
before its news
the key strategic move that influenced the outcome
you could argue the move that influenced the outcome was the lack of preparation across the entire coaching staff prior to setting foot in london and not arriving there much earlier but thats another story that im sure my colleagues will touch on
tactically this game largely comes down to evaluating blake bortles performance bortles wasnt bortles at all maybe he needed the support from the jaguar fans across the pond but really maybe all he needed was to face dean pees defense
now give a lot of credit to jacksonville offensive coordinator nathaniel hackett who devised a terrific game plan that kept the baltimore defense on its heels early and often the jaguars ran presnap shifts and misdirection to get the baltimore defenders out of position he sprinkled in screens to expose the lack of openfield instincts of the linebackers and most importantly he gave bortles easy completions on first down he kept bortles in a comfortable position
but pees passive and predictable game plan certainly made things comfortable too he once again relied on his straight fourman rush to apply pressure on bortles with a smattering of stunts and twists its almost as if the second brandon carr gave up a long completion down the right sideline against marqise lee pees went into a shell with his playcalling and elected not to challenge bortles with any combination of bluff or blitz action
jacksonville didnt give up a sniff of pressure let alone a sack when pees showed the blitz too early on a key 3rdand11 play bortles easily slid his protection to pick it up the weddle blitz in which bortles was able to escape and buy time to extend the play was laughably executed the blitz was declared way too early and there was no deception as to where the blitz was coming from
i understand the players didnt execute either weddle deserves his share of blame for the play for tipping it too soon and not finishing the tackle but where was all the presnap movement pees showed in the preseason at the minimum he would have his defenders crowd the line sometimes stressing the a gaps sometimes stressing the edges with overload looks he often brought his backers on cross blitzes and the corners were held responsible for locking things down in oneonone coverage on the back end
considering the investment thats been made in this secondary it seemed logical that the rush would be freed up to take more chances the defensive coaching staff talked about playing that style of defense so far its been a lot of hot air and more of the same hold on for dear life defense weve seen year after year
theres nothing wrong with relying more on your front to win their individual matchups to apply pressure on the qb but when they cant get it done you have to try something different at least give more playing time to the one guy who was getting any pressure at all tim williams and stop dropping one of your most effective rushers matt judon into coverage
to this point the schemes have been just as tired as the rhetoric that this defense will be aggressive
what went right
the only thing that went right was on the offensive side of the ball and that had more to do with alex collins performance than anything else cant really point to scheme as the positive here he just ran hard and has shown the extra burst to turn the corner the coaching staff needs to get him more opportunities on counters traps and sweep action
what went wrong
theres a laundry list and the defense has been hit hard already lets switch to the offense
offensive coordinator marty mornhinweg could learn something from hackett and mix in more screens to give the offense better earlydown efficiency or how about some runpass option plays i watched plenty of football on sunday to drown out the awfulness of london and the rest of the league is all over the runpass option play or as tony romo calls them rpos green bay cincinnati pittsburgh washington they all have those option plays built into their offense
when the ravens receivers face any level of off coverage there has been no attempt by joe flacco to get them the ball quickly to let them make moves in space now i know what youre going to say jacksonville corners jalen ramsey and aj bouye pressed the receivers all day so those plays wouldnt have worked anyway its a fair point
but this has been an issue forever and there is a way to use stacks and motion to free the receivers up this is a static offense though that shows too many balanced looks
the receivers arent given help to get a clean release
the strength and talent of this offense is its three receivers you must figure out a way for them to get the ball whether its in space or downfield right now the ravens havent had anything resembling a downfield passing attack and a lot of that blame goes to flacco
defenses are sitting on their underneath routes playing press and daring the receivers to win and this coaching staff isnt doing anything to adjust

"__label__real tokyo reuters japans dentsu inc was fined just 500000 yen 4400 after a tokyo court ruled it had made employees work overtime beyond legal limits a case that followed a high profile death from overwork at the advertising giant
labour practices at dentsu renowned for its harddriving work culture came under scrutiny after employee matsuri takahashi committed suicide in 2015 at the age of 24 the government later ruled she died of karoshi literally death by overwork
the case prompted national soulsearching and helped spur government plans for sweeping reforms of labor laws even so the problem of karoshi has once again been thrust into the spotlight this week with public broadcaster nhk disclosing that a 31yearold reporter died four years ago of overwork
prosecutors had charged dentsu for making takahashi and three others work overtime beyond limits agreed with the companys labor union between october and december 2015 but current japanese law only allows for relatively small fines for breaches relating to overtime
we are hoping for legislative change so that stiffer penalties can be imposed when a worker dies takahashis mother yukimi said in a statement after the ruling
its not just my daughter tragic cases like this are happening throughout japan across all industries and irrespective of whether firms are large or small she added noting the death of the nhk reporter
matsuri takahashi had worked 105 hours of overtime in october 2015 after which she fell into depression she jumped to her death from a company dormitory on christmas day leaving behind a trail of public grievances on social media about her relentless working hours and bosss verbal abuse

we take this ruling very seriously and extend our deepest apologies to stakeholders and the general public for the concern we have caused dentsu said in a statement adding that ceo toshihiro yamamoto will take a 20 percent pay cut for six months
japan had 191 deaths which authorities have ruled as related to overwork in the past financial year an increase of two over the previous year the government said in an annual report on friday
nhk which has covered the dentsu case and the problem of karoshi in japanese society extensively on air said it had decided to disclose its own case to ensure thorough reform within the company the reporter died of congestive heart failure after clocking 159 hours of overtime in the month before her death

prime minister shinzo abes administration this year endorsed an action plan for sweeping reforms of employment practices including caps on overtime and better pay for parttime and contract workers
the moves while widely welcome also come at a time when japanese companies are also grappling with a deepening labor shortage as the nations population rapidly ages
despite pledges of reform by many companies some japanese workers were skeptical
my company says its promoting work reform but i am doing as much overtime as before i even work on saturdays said a 38year old female employee at a japanese bank
unless the bank cuts down our total workload overtime cannot be reduced she said declining to give her name or identify her company out of fear of upsetting her employer"

a court in australia has accepted an unsent draft text message on a dead mans mobile phone as an official will
the 55yearold man had composed a text message addressed to his brother in which he gave all that i have to his brother and nephew
the message was found in the drafts folder on the mans phone after he took his own life last year 
brisbane supreme court ruled that the wording of the text indicated that the man intended it to act as his will
in the message the man gave details of how to access his bank account and where he had hidden money in his house
put my ashes in the back garden he wrote a bit of cash behind tv and a bit in the bank
according to abc news the mans wife applied to manage his assets and argued that the text message was not valid as a will because it was never sent
typically for a will to be valid in queensland it must be written and signed by two witnesses
justice susan brown said the wording of the text message which ended with the words my will showed that the man intended it to act as his will
the reference to his house and superannuation and his specification that the applicant was to take her own things indicates he was aware of the nature and extent of his estate which was relatively small she said
she said the informal nature of the message did not stop it representing the mans intentions especially as it was created on or about the time that the deceased was contemplating death such that he even indicated where he wanted his ashes to be placed
validity of wills
in 2006 the law in queensland was changed to allow less formal types of documents to be considered as a will
another unusual will accepted in queensland includes a dvd marked with my will in 2013
the uks law commission is currently fielding a public consultation on the legal rules applying to wills
the proposals listed by the body includes giving courts the capacity to dispense with the formalities for a will where its clear what the deceased wanted"

but in an earlier era the two men appeared together amicably ahead of the 2004 presidential election mr trump made a cameo in the eminem concert special the shady national convention which aired on mtv i know a winner when i see one mr trump said in an endorsement of eminems alterego slim shady donald trump is telling you right now slim shady is a winner hes got brains hes got guts and hes got donald trumps vote
the rappers dense blistering lyrics have courted controversy in the past with some accusing him of writing homophobic and misogynistic verses
and this is not the first time that eminem has tackled politics in his songs he has also taken aim at bill clinton hillary clinton and george w bush last october he released the freestyle track campaign speech in which he called mr trump a loose cannon whos blunt with his hand on the button
eminem is thought to be gearing up for the release this year of his eighth majorlabel album and first since the marshall mathers lp 2 in 2013 a longtime producer for the rapper said earlier this month that the new music was done in the last few years he has popped up for occasional guest verses and soundtrack songs he is featured on pinks revenge out friday but has largely remained in the shadows away from celebrity and social media
sometimes i think that if i get comfortable or set in my ways of doing something maybe i should step back for a minute and figure out how to mix it up a little bit he told the new york times in 2015
other hiphop artists and rappers have also targeted the president in their lyrics and music videos the california rapper yg released a single last august called fdt in which he repeatedly curses mr trumps name kendrick lamar lashed out at mr trump in his tracks the heart part 4 and xxx snoop doggs music video lavender in which the rapper aimed a toy pistol at a clown resembling mr trump earned a rebuke and a call for jail time from the president himself in march"

what a crazy week 3 in the nfl theres so much to talk about but well keep it as brief as possible since youre likely sitting at your desk reading this looking for your boss out of your peripheries or hoping that obnoxious coworker who wears too much perfume doesnt stroll by to chat and contaminate your personal space
i would be remiss if i did not address the political aspects controversies of this weekend so here it goes
i gotta tell ya i feel so much better getting that off my chest
as for the play on the field heres a quick recap of what you either saw missed or disregarded
6 of the 8 previously undefeated teams done got defeated
running backs came back to life zeke showed up dalvin cook returned to form run cmc broke through so on and so forth
i had sammy watkins pierre garcon and stephon diggs all on my fantasy bench they all went ape sht so thats neat
overall it was a very strange weekend in the nfl but i will say this everybody is talking about them i mean everybody even nonfootball fans have their name on the tips of their collective tongues
i cant imagine thats a bad thing for them
last week a score i wont write
the ravens went to london and fell harder than london bridge in that hot jam
again well do the abbreviated version for those who turned it off in some form of disgust
first the ravens did this
then this
and it ended like this
at that point quoth the beck the fans get up and they get out of town
back to baltimore tail between their legs with steelers week looming large
this week steelers ravens sunday 101 1pm
last week the ravens sucked like beyond bad beyond awful just flat out sucked outplayed outcoached outhearteded just got blown away in every facet of the game
that game i believe was an anomaly this isnt to say the ravens would beat the jags 910 times simply to say the jags arent as good as a 44point effort on any given week and the ravens arent as bad as a 7point junk time score or giving up 44 on defense
this team is much better and theyll show it this week injuries be damned
meanwhile the steelers are an interesting creature
while baltimore put up 2 stout performances followed by a dud the steelers 21 have a solid 269 win in week 2 against the vikings sandwiched by 2 duds
in week 1 pittsburgh eeked out a win against a currently 03 browns team by a score of 2118 then in week 3 lost in overtime to the hapless bears 1723 in a game that could have been decided in regulation had bears marcus cooper who had scooped up a blocked field goal attempt by pittsburgh and headed for the end zone not fumbled as he was showboating over the goalline and cost the team 4 points they settled for a field goal
all erroneous though week 4 is upon us and the steelers and ravens come in with a major chip on their shoulders
weve yet to see leveon bell be that guy for the steelers and weve yet to see well anything on offense consistently for the ravens on defense however weve seen the ravens be great its just a matter of whether or not they can return to that level again this week
prediction
ultimately i think both teams play better than they did last week
the problem with that
the steelers lost by an overtime touchdown while the ravens got pummeled by breaks out calculator a literal tonne
joe flacco will bounce back with 2 scores and the usual pair of picks hitting buck allen twice in the end zone the ravens will total only 250 yards of offense although their defense will steal a pair of big ben picks to shorten the field for baltimore
while that all sounds fine and dandy the steelers offense wont come up short again this week roethlisberger will find antonio brown for 2 touchdowns and a third from jesse james eventually leading to a 1score game in the 4th quarter
unfortunately the steelers have the lead in the 1score game and manage to milk to clock to end it much like they did in cleveland as they steal one from the ravens who fall to 22 and the fans go bonkers asking about top5 draft picks whether the ravens will take a quarterback and how soon we can fire everybody
bal 24 pit 28 the best of the rest
who knew the best games last week would be the ones we thought would end up most lopsided i never wouldve expected the steelers to lose to the bears or the bills to beat the broncos
yet here we are
hopefully well see more of those shockertype games this week as the full slate isnt exactly exhilarating outside of ravenssteelers but alas heres the best of the rest
patriots panthers sunday 101 1pm in case the ravens game gets out of control hopefully in baltimores favor this game may be worth a flip if for no other reason to mock the patriots dead last in the nfl in points allowed dead last in passing ypg allowed 24th in rush ypg allowed feel a little better about the ravens defense yet
denver oakland sunday 101 425pm two teams that started the season hot at 20 fell to lesser teams in week 3 who will rebound will trevor semian return to his surprising early season hot streak will marshawn lynch dance again will jets fans be offended even though theyre not in this game only time will tell
skins chiefs monday 102 830pm honestly i just want to see the skins fanbase fall back down to earth after they treated last weeks game against the raiders as a true indicator that theyre some force to be reckoned with it stung even worse after the ravens roast vengeance from the other side of the bw parkway must be had
rank em
i could take this a million directions this week
i mean it is steelers week so lets go ahead and mock them while we have a chance right
perhaps well save that for its own article could run on a bit beyond 5
instead well go ahead and laugh off our pain from last sunday
top5 things i couldve done with my time instead of watching the wimbley whooping
5 study the nfl officiating rule book seeing the flags thrown at the ravens gives me reason to believe my services wouldnt go to waste
4 learn the ravens fight song i still only know fight fight fight and lets be honest so do you
3 start looking at 2018 mock drafts hard not to want to see who will be available in the top half of the 18 draft after that embarrassment
2 check in with browns bengals fans after all misery loves company
1 watch a steelers fan burn his leveon bell jersey oh no wait i did do that

the nine men have come to the chinese border town of dandong from mansudae art studio north koreas largest producer of art there are many outlets like this along the border they house some of the thousands of north korean artists who cater to burgeoning demand for their work chinese have begun collecting art and north korean art is much easier and cheaper for them to obtain says park youngjeong a research fellow at the korea culture and tourism institute a seoulbased organization
in recent years as countries have responded to north koreas weapons tests with sanctions mansudae and other art studios have increasingly played a more controversial role helping pyongyang raise cash abroad north korea has long been punished for alleged underhand dealings in minerals finance and arms art was seen more as a channel for mutual understanding that is changing

mansudae is run by the north korean state its output ranges from statues of global leaders to propaganda posters embroidery and more it has built monuments and statues in at least 15 african countries according to independent united nations sanctions experts
in a report in february they said that a part of mansudae called mansudae overseas projects was a front for the north korean state to cash in on military deals as well as monumental statues they found it built military installations such as a munitions factory and bases in namibia
a diplomat at the north korean mission to the un in geneva said mansudae had nothing to do with funding weapons manufacturing no one from mansudae could be reached
the un security council banned mansudaes statue business in 2016 on aug 5 after pyongyang conducted more weapons tests the security council blacklisted mansudae art studio subjecting it to a global asset freeze and travel ban diplomats say this will prevent mansudae from conducting business
with this listing anything mansudae produces including paintings other artwork monuments buildings and other construction cannot be bought and should be frozen per the asset freeze said a un security council diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity
in a further resolution on sept 11 the security council decided that all joint ventures with north korean entities or individuals must be shut down within 120 days or by midjanuary

exactly what the measures mean for existing mansudae art has yet to become clear in beijings art district a gallery called the mansudae art gallery says it is the studios official overseas gallery its head insists the sanctions do not apply to it and says they have had no impact on his business
now more than ever we need avenues like art to create understanding between north korea and the rest of the world said ji zhengtai
it is not possible to estimate the total value of mansudaes dealings but the security council diplomat said the business had earned tens of millions of dollars globally

we dont do politics
mansudaeartsudiocom a website in italy which calls itself mansudaes official website abroad says the studio is probably the largest art production center in the world
mansudaes pyongyang studio covers 120000 sq m nearly 30 acres employs about 4000 people including around 1000 artists and is divided into 13 creative groups seven manufacturing plants and more than 50 supply departments the website says
the website is run by pier luigi cecioni who sells mansudae works online and at fairs through what he calls an exclusive agreement with mansudae art studio he declined to say how much he sells but in august after the sanctions on mansudae art studio were announced he told reuters that the revenues go direct to the studio to pay for paints and equipment
remembrance by jang kilnam courtesy bg muhn remembrance by jang kilnam courtesy bg muhn
cecioni said he sells works from his personal collection most of them bought several years ago before sanctions on mansudae were announced his website makes clear that any online purchase is made with his italian company not mansudae un sanctions are not retroactive
a panel of independent experts is charged with monitoring un sanctions on north korea it reports violations and recommendations to the security councils north korea sanctions committee its reports are confidential but the committee traditionally publishes annual reports
the head of the mansudae art museum ji zhengtai talks about a painting by a north korean artist in the studio of the gallery in the 798 art district in beijing china september 20 2017 reutersthomas peter
hugh griffiths who heads the panel declined to comment saying the matter is subject to an ongoing investigation
cecioni said the last thing i want is to have trouble with italian or american authorities i have strong contacts especially with the italian ones and they help me to respect all the rules an italian foreign ministry source said it is customary to keep contact with everyone who has ties to countries under sanctions to ensure they respect italys international commitments
in september cecioni said that he had no plans to shut down his operation i consider it very important to let people know that north koreans do not make only bombs but also art and are common people he said he postponed an exhibition of propaganda posters he had planned for september in treviso but said this was because mansudaes representatives told him they thought it unwise to showcase their antius tone in the current climate
word of the sanctions has been slower to reach china a circular from its commerce ministry announcing the start date of the measures which included mansudae art studio does not name mansudae asked why not the ministry did not respond
the dandong center works in partnership with mansudae said its manager gai longji asked on the day the sanctions took effect if they were affecting business he did not answer directly
we dont do politics he said we do art liaoning sanyi the firm behind the center did not respond to a request for comment
white tiger
reuters spoke to at least 30 experts collectors art historians academics and people who have sold north korean art globally many said the market for paintings is niche and amounts to little in terms of revenue compared with the billionplus dollars north korea has raised every year selling coal and other minerals abroad

even so they say north korean diplomats in europe have been enthusiastic to promote art exhibitions with the simple aim of bringing in hard currency
in china demand has really taken off dandong is a popular attraction for tourists who come to peep at north koreans over the yalu river border busloads of tourists show up every morning visitors sample a north korean specialty of noodles in cold soup watch north korean women sing and dance and buy north korean paintings
besides mansudae just about every ministry and almost all the local authorities in north korea have an art studio said koen de ceuster a lecturer in korean studies at leiden university who has been studying north korean art for over a decade theres studios all across the country he said
other prominent studio names include paekho and the central arts studio paekho which means white tiger in korean is the biggest seller of popular paintings in dandong traders there said collectors who have dealt with paekho say it is run by north koreas military reuters could not independently establish this paekhos varied output includes propaganda posters calling for a nuclearfree world
the dandong center that reuters visited has hosted around 500 north korean artists since 2014 manager gai said they stay for between six months and three years
many dandong galleries house north korean painters staff there said they have sold north korean paintings for as much as 100000 to buyers around the world art experts agree the pieces can very occasionally fetch sixfigure sums
not all the proceeds go to pyongyang markups can reach four or five times the dealers purchase price according to one dandong dealer

long game
while the security councils aug 5 sanctions targeted only mansudae its september resolution on joint ventures also included restrictions on north korean labor this combination could hurt everyone in the art business dandong traders say
but there are ways around the measures they add for instance paintings from mansudae could be sold under the name of an art studio that hasnt been sanctioned artists come to china under cultural exchange visas not as workers and two businessmen said paintings have long been accepted instead of cash in the barter deals that fuel the regions economy
at the other end of the border from dandong in the city of yanji chinese antiques dealer zhao xiangchen said people usually roll up a couple of paintings and carry them quietly across the border to him
his antiques stall was thick with dust as he camped in a vacant slot next door selling the paintings online
since the sanctions were announced zhao said chinese customs have become more vigilant
but im playing the long game he said i still think theres huge latent demand for north korean art in the chinese market thats only set to grow

we spoke to her ahead of her solo headline show at the islington academy in north london
youre playing brixton academy its an iconic london venue have you played there before
i have just once supporting bombay bicycle club a few years ago and it was absolutely amazing its such a crazy venue just a big building that feels a bit overwhelming but im looking forward to it
where do you feel most comfortable big or small venues
its got that similar kind of scale and the balcony is amazing because you can see people but i really love the big ones theres a mystery that you can kind of take on board and be more of an elusive character whereas if its intimate youve got to really engage with people the big ones are fun
can you remember the first time you came on to the radar of bbc introducing
im from blackpool and i guess radio lancashire was my local radio and i remember a guy called sean mcginty from bbc introducing put me on the radio pretty much straight away id put tracks on myspace and then i remember going into the building to do my first live show with him and just being so nervous but absolutely loving it then he put me forward to do this bbc introducing master class at abbey road and i came down to that with my mum and dad
i remember making some demo cds and managing to give one to former radio 1 dj zane lowe and realising that there was nothing on it when i got home that was kind of unfortunate but it worked out in the end he probably thought this is really avant garde just nothing
i dont know whether he listened to it but i was so sad when i got back home and realised
image copyright nick pickles
is one of bbc introducings strengths that it isnt centralised in london and local stations across the country have their own branches
absolutely thats whats amazing about it particularly coming from somewhere as small as blackpool it was really tricky to get your music out there in a big way and now the internet is better but its just a brilliant way to bring everyone together and compile new amazing music together
how much space did it give you to hone your craft
theres a massive pressure to be perfect straight away to be the finished article and introducing allows you to think i have this potential but youre going to watch me grow and be there with me for the journey i definitely have lots of lovely fans that come to gigs who have been there since the very beginning and remember hearing me on radio lancashire back in the day
can you remember what you performed on that first session
yes im going to play one of those songs tonight theyre still part of my set one of my first songs was called wait a while and a song called for you that was on my first record and they were the ones that i wrote in blackpool in my shed and theyre still around which is nice
any of the other bands playing tonight that youve played with before
george ezra ive played with quite a lot he supported me on one of my first tours and we played the smallest venue in bath and theres a picture of us on that day and even the fact he was supporting me is amazing because thats the kind of journey you go through on bbc introducing and as artists you grow and experience things together as a community
everything everything did a remix for me which is amazing and i love slaves im so excited about seeing them i dont know them but i think theyre wicked
image copyright atlatic records
is it about paying it forward and supporting new artists coming up
its so important and its something that you could forget about if youre super busy and i understand when people get massive the pressure they come under but just last night in leeds we had a girl called lucy whittaker who was bbc introducing track of the week on radio 1 and that was just great that she was with us
i played a festival a couple of years ago with tori amos and she wrote me this little note before the gig she didnt need to do it but it was really special and it made me realise you should always do that because it means a lot to younger people
what was in the note
it was a festival in norway and she was headlining and she wrote a little card just saying hi rae good luck have an amazing gig love tori and she got me a beautiful scarf that i will dig out for winter that i wear every year
it was really lovely and she didnt need to do it it was really thoughtful i dont have it framed but i keep it by my bed
raes album is due out in spring 2018

"__label__real senegalese migrants in barcelona spain hold a meeting at the offices of the diomcoop cooperative which helps undocumented migrants find an alternative to peddling goods illegally on the streets august 31 2017 thomson reuters foundationsophie davies
barcelona thomson reuters foundation when alioune thiam arrived in barcelona he joined hundreds of other undocumented african migrants peddling their wares illegally on the streets now hes part of a scheme to give some of the spanish citys most vulnerable people an alternative
senegaleseborn thiam arrived in barcelona by plane in 2007 joining his brother but he couldnt get a job because he didnt have a work permit
if you dont have papers you cant work the 44yearold told the thomson reuters foundation
he didnt choose to become an illegal street vendor he said when you arrive you dont have any other option there are people that live here for five years seven years without papers he explained
for him the hardest part is that these migrants are left in limbo while they wait and cannot go home as they would not be allowed to reenter spain
today thiam who continued selling sarongs and jewelry on the streets until he got a work permit in 2011 wants to give others the chance to stay on the right side of the law
he is a member of diomcoop an initiative launched in march that enables street hawkers to undergo business training and sell merchandise at official city markets in return they must agree to stop trading illegally
the project is supported by barcelona city council which has committed 800000 euros 950000 over the next three years
diomcoop which draws its name from a wolof word signifying inner strength is an effort to address the problem of migrants making a living in illegal ways because they are not permitted to work an issue common to many other cities said its technical coordinator ababacar thiakh
belonging to the cooperative should open up a way for members to access residency permits and regularize their legal status according to barcelona city hall
the public has so far responded well to diomcoops handmade clothes jewelry and bags some sourced from artisans homes in senegal because they offer an alternative to the goods typically sold by street traders said thiakh
those items include counterfeit designer handbags sunglasses trainers and football shirts bought from chinese importers in the suburbs
the idea with diomcoop is to offer something different from massmarket products thiakh said people are selling very cool stuff in their homes so we wanted to make the most of that he added
humble beginnings
diomcoop is managed from a modest headquarters in the basement of a block of flats in el clot a neighborhoods far from the citys tourist areas
in this quiet workingclass district which used to house many textile factories in barcelonas industrial heyday that tradition is coming alive once again with diomcoops work
piles of brightly colored african fabrics are strewn across tables in contrast to the unadorned white walls of the office there is a feeling of optimism as everyone mucks in to prepare for the next market
yet despite its early success thiakh admits the cooperative needs a stronger business plan to make its work more viable over the longerterm
handmade senegalese handbags hats and shoes are among the items on sale at a market stall run by the diomcoop cooperative at a festival in sants barcelona august 26 2017 thomson reuters foundationsophie davies
with only 15 members all from senegal it is also very small there are an estimated 400 unlicensed traders on the streets of barcelona
diomcoop plans to double its membership to 30 there is a high level of interest and it may move into new lines of business in future like offering services or food thiakh said
migrant unemployment
thiam waited four years to receive his immigration papers an experience echoed by thousands of others
there are nearly 19000 undocumented african migrants living in spain in addition to more than 1 million documented africans according to state statistics
but unofficial estimates say there could be up to 50000 undocumented african migrants in the country more than double the registered figure
slideshow 2 images
i dont think the real number would be far from that said jesús fernándezhuertas moraga an economics professor at carlos iii university of madrid uc3m
in the past undocumented migrants who registered with the government could access healthcare but the law was changed in 2012 removing a powerful incentive to sign up he added
even when migrants do get their papers finding a job is not always easy once legalized thiam said he couldnt find work because jobs were so scarce during spains economic crisis
the crisis which began nearly a decade ago led to unemployment for millions of people with migrants some of the worstaffected
in the second quarter of 2017 unemployment among documented and undocumented immigrants in spain was 23 percent 6 percent above the national average according to the state population survey of all continents african immigrants had the highest unemployment rate at 38 percent
bundled in a blanket
unlicensed traders tend to congregate in tourist hotspots near barcelonas beaches or line the streets hugging the marina with its super yachts and private members clubs
known locally as manteros the sellers display their goods on large blankets mantas with ropes tied to each end this means they can quickly bundle everything together sling it over one shoulder and disappear down a side street when the police arrive
those that are caught face fines confiscation of their goods or detention if they cant show id proving they have the right to live and work in spain serial offenders can be handed prison sentences of up to two years and deported
another group of barcelona street traders launched an official fashion label called top manta earlier this year in an attempt to move away from unlicensed selling
these small grassroots projects cannot solve the problem experts say but they could change lives in more subtle ways
for ndeye fatou mbaye president of diomcoop they can help people who are in a vulnerable situation so that they can have a life of dignity
they can also show migrants there is not only street selling but other opportunities to make a living she added"

we know of many stories and urban myths that we learn one way or another especially during our childhoods and we come to realize of how ridiculous all of these sound
 
but could all legends be but an exageration of a simpler story something our ancestors wrote down as a twisted interpretation of an average situation

"__label__real mumbai reuters indian banks sour loans hit a record 95 trillion rupees 14556 billion at the end of june unpublished data shows suggesting asias thirdlargest economy is no nearer to bringing its bad debt problems under control
a review of reserve bank of india rbi data obtained through righttoinformation requests shows banks total stressed loans including nonperforming and restructured or rolled over loans rose 45 percent in the six months to endjune in the previous six months they had risen 58 percent
while banks remain the main source of funding for indias companies the stubborn bad debt problem has eaten into bank profits and choked off new lending especially to smaller firms at a time when an economy that depends on them is stalling
india grew at its slowest pace in three years in apriljune a concern for the government of prime minister narendra modi who faces elections in 2019 and has pledged to create millions of new jobs before then
banks are having to take higher provisions to account for more defaulters being pushed into bankruptcy and margins are likely to be squeezed further by proposed new rules to encourage commercial banks to pass on central bank interest rate cuts
to be sure the bulk of indias sour loans are in the state banks and stem from lending to large conglomerates especially in steel and infrastructure but analysts say the rise in bad loans among small firms and even retail borrowing is worrying and will do little to encourage new loans to help fuel growth
on the corporate side we think its a recognition cycle which is nearing an end said alka anbarasu senior analyst at moodys investor service referring to more bad loans being recognized as such as banks come under pressure from the rbi and other regulators but its really those data points beyond corporate that are causing some worry
anbarasu forecast weak quarters ahead for banks before profitability picks up and several senior bankers from public sector lenders which account for more than twothirds of indian banking assets agreed the months ahead would be strained
stressed loans as a percentage of total loans reached 126 percent at endjune according to the rbi data the highest level in at least 15 years
higher provisions weaker loans
part of the issue for banks and the government is a strict provisioning regime the rbi wants banks to provide for at least 50 percent of the secured loans to companies taken to bankruptcy proceedings and 100 percent for the unsecured part
a dozen of the biggest such cases account for nearly 178 trillion rupees or a quarter of total nonperforming assets
for those companies banks will need to provide 180 billion rupees on top of existing provisions according to july estimates from india ratings and research the local affiliate of fitch ratings
more than 20 other sizeable companies are at risk of being taken to bankruptcy court
bankers say these and other pressures including rising government bond yields that forced banks to post marktomarket losses have added to the squeeze and hit new loans
according to rbi data new loans grew at just about 5 percent in the year to march the lowest growth rate in more than six decades several banks have already cut back their loan books to conserve capital
what are they rbi thinking while theyre taking these steps all at the same time said a treasurer at a staterun bank who didnt want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue do they want banks to wind up their businesses or do they want to save the banks
treasury income accounted for 227 percent of banks operating profits in the last financial year doubling its share from a year earlier india ratings estimates
the almost zero treasury income will hit provisioning ability and in turn make it more difficult for weaker banks to give loans as capital becomes more scarce said soumyajit niyogi an associate director at the rating agency
a senior policymaker who requested anonymity as the discussions are not public said the government would have to help to sufficiently capitalize the banks
fitch ratings estimates indian banks will need 65 billion of additional capital by march 2019 to meet basel iii global banking rules moodys expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly 15 billion the government has just 3 billion left in its budget for bank recapitalization
we think capitalization is the biggest challenge for the banks at the moment given that earnings will remain subdued and will not support any capital generation said moodys anbarasu"

before its news

it has been argued that scouting takes the joy out of football sometimes it is fun to simply watch a game unfold and to enjoy the athleticism of the players without losing oneself in their potential as future nfl stars
mel kiper and todd mcshay spend their days looking at young talent and they know how to spot a future nfl star however the players they have listed below have less to do with how they would have impacted the college football lines for week 5 games and more to do with the fun they bring to the game
if you are looking for talented athletes that are merely fun to watch consider these guys
saquon barkley
as far as psu running backs are concerned saquon is something special at least on the college level forget about leonard fournette this is a 230pound player that makes lateral cuts he shouldnt be capable of with amazing breakaway speed saquon makes waves in every game in which he plays
baker mayfield
this oklahoma qbs future in the nfl is a little uncertain but when you see him run around for fifteen seconds only to throw the ball downfield you will quickly forget about all the whining surrounding his small size and lacking arm strength you know he will be in the heisman conversation this season
sam darnold
this usc qb is the total package not only is he a team player availing his receivers the opening to make plays but he has a way of using his physical prowess to extend plays utilizing the entire field and countering any argument being made about his interceptions
darnold doesnt look anything like a sophomore when hes on the field
damien harris
everyone that kept crying about this alabama rb not being on par with 5star recruits like josh jacobs has been forced to eat their words harris doesnt look like hes anything special until you see the consistent reliability he brings to the table harris always performs at his best regardless of the conditions or the challenger
christian kirk
it isnt just his stats 19 catches 250 yards 4 touchdowns that make this texas am wr such a catch besides speed and agility kirk is always willing to go over the muddle
devin bush
this michigan lb is following in the footsteps of his father who was scouted in 1995 by lining up all over the field making so many plays and proving to his naysayers why he might be better than maurice hurst you wont find that many sophomores that hit so hard
roquan smith
this georgia ilb has been compared to cj mosley and coach kirby smart agrees georgias defense is pretty loaded and yet smith has found a way to stand out
hercules mataafa
this washington state de is versatile that is his strength comparable to the likes of deone bucannon and already boasting 45 sacks so far in the new season the athlete has shown an incredible ability to play on his feet and on the edge
if youve been paying close attention to college football then you know that theres a lot of talent to marvel at from ben banogu of tcu to deatrick nichols of south florida and elijah marks of northern arizona

"__label__real vielha spain reuters if catalonia declares independence from spain this week one community in the regions mountainous north might declare independence from catalonia
most people in the picturesque aran valley a semiautonomous community nestled among the pyrenees want to stay with spain and the area has the right to selfdetermination under a law passed in 2015 by the catalan parliament
were a little spot on the map and often were not taken into account said maria verges perez the deputy mayor of arans capital vielha a cluster of stoneandslate houses on the valley floor ringed by autumnal forests
but we will exercise our right to decide our future
catalan president carles puigdemont is expected to declare independence on tuesday in spains worst constitutional crisis since the return of democracy in the 1970s
the roughly 10000 people of aran on the border with france have a language and culture distinct from the rest of catalonia which itself differs from the rest of spain the valleys economy is heavily dependent on winter sports tourists from spain and the eu
their politicians say the 2015 law gives them the right to vote on whether they want to break away with catalonia something which catalan officials do not dispute
the spanish government has vowed to prevent catalonia seceding losing the region would deprive the country of 16 percent of its people and a fifth of its economic output
but while madrid insists spain is indivisible under its constitution the aran valley underlines the complex nature of nationhood in such a culturally diverse country
ever since spains return to democracy in the 1970s madrid has struggled to balance the countrys patchwork of regional identities including its decadeslong fight to quell separatism in the northern basque country led by violent militants eta
related coverage catalan govt to blame for companies exodus from region spanish finance minister
few in the medieval villages along the aran valley doubt the community would opt to stay with spain if asked to vote
the people here feel very far away from what is going on in barcelona said carlos barrera head of the aran government at a rural festival in salardu village where locals judged stocky pyrenean horses and handed out racks of blood sausages
crown of aragon
the valley had the lowest voter turnout by far in catalonias oct 1 independence referendum which had been declared illegal by spains constitutional court
across catalonia there was a 43 percent turnout with most people who wanted to remain in spain staying home and 90 percent of those who voted backed secession in aran just 24 percent voted with 84 percent of those backing independence
the valley traces its political allegiances back to pacts drawn up in the 13th century with the crown of aragon a monarchy that would join with the crown of castille two centuries later to form what became spain many locals speak aranese a dialect of the occitan language still spoken in pockets of the pyrenees and southern france
a man walks through the town of vielha carrying a spanish flag in the val daran catalonia spain october 7 2017 reutersvincent west
two years ago the catalan parliament approved the law on arans special status giving it control over its culture language and administration and recognizing the right of the aranese people to decide their future
a catalan government spokesman said catalonia would respect the aranese peoples decision in any future referendum
a spanish government spokesman declined to comment on whether aran could remain part of spain saying catalonia would never become independent
arans residents are some of the sternest critics of the catalan government which they say is ignoring those people who want to stay in spain and charging toward independence at any cost
in vielha a lone red and yellow catalan independence flag hanging from an apartment block was the only evidence last saturday of the separatist fever sweeping many parts of the region where cities convulse with protests triggered by madrids violent crackdown on the referendum
slideshow 17 images
price of independence
many people in aran fear catalan independence would destroy its tourism economy which revolves around baqueiraberet spains most popular ski resort
about twothirds of the population in aran depend on the ski resort for jobs in the winter the population triples with the influx of skiers drawn to the same slopes used by spains royal family
since the referendum verges perez the vielha deputy mayor said potential visitors had canceled almost 30 percent of hotel reservations for next weeks local holidays and if an independent catalonia was no longer part of the european union arans reliance on agreements to use french hospitals for medical emergencies would be jeopardized she added
thats the trap nobody has explained the price that independence like this would have she said
many of catalonias largest businesses have already said they are transferring their headquarters out of the region due to the political turmoil insurance firm catalana occidente owned by the same family that owns baqueiraberet is reportedly considering doing the same although it has not confirmed it
the valley ranks as one of catalonias wealthiest regions thanks to a tunnel that opened it up to the rest of spain in 1948 before then it was a poor area only accessible by an often snowcovered mountain pass
the valleys politicians say holding their own referendum could be the only way to defend the local economy
but jaime geli salardus 72yearold former mayor and one of the few independence supporters here said locals shouldnt be so quick to throw their lot in with spain instead of sticking with catalonia
catalan authorities had protected the aranese culture and language from a central government hostile to the idea that spain is made up of different nations he said sat by the valleys river
in madrid when you talk to them about different languages it makes their hairs stand up on end

 of readers think this story is fact add your two cents
before its news
the baltimore ravens will spend the week trying desperately to keep the season from unraveling
a pair of losses already has the team scrambling for answers especially on offense
quarterback joe flacco has thrown for one touchdown with four interceptions over the recent twogame skid the ravens were outscored 440 in the first half of those games and simply could not recover because they are not built to play from behind
there doesnt appear to be any quickfix solutions to the problems
everything that we do on offense is a little bit aided either by turnovers good field position stuff like that flacco said were not creating a lot for ourselves right now were just going the hard way obviously with that one long run it popped but besides that one long run were not getting any big plays theres a couple out there were just missing them
flacco missed all of training camp with an ailing back however he said numerous times that injury has not affected his performance
in four games this season flacco has completed just 73 of 118 pass attempts for 601 yards with four touchdowns and six interceptions
the loss of right guard marshal yanda to a seasonending ankle injury cannot be overstated yanda is the anchor of the offensive and that unit has struggled without him in the lineup
flacco has also been sacked six times over the past two games and has been limited to mostly checkdowns because he doesnt have time to look downfield
the ravens have the 31stranked passing offense with 570 yards just ahead of miami 548
weve got to be better off early in games flacco said so thats the type of game thats going to benefit us right now is being good early and then putting teams away and when were trying to climb back in games like we were today theres opportunities to do it and we werent good enough to do it that starts with me i wasnt good enough to get us back in the game
the ravens defense was expected to help carry the team while that was the case in a pair of victories to open the season that unit has also struggled in the recent losses the team has sorely missed defensive tackle brandon williams who missed the last two games with a foot injury
without williams in the lineup the jacksonville jaguars amassed 166 rushing yards in a 447 victory week 3 in london the ravens then had no answer for leveon bell who had 144 yards on 35 carries with two touchdowns in pittsburghs 269 win
still the ravens were not using the absence of williams as an excuses for their struggles against the run
in a sense it affects us linebacker cj mosley said the next guy has to step up when he comes back well be ready for him but we just cant make that as an excuse if anything the guy thats behind him have got to see what he does on those types of runs or watch a little more film and see what you need to work on for those types of runs youve got to figure it out as a whole group
the ravens face another tough challenge this week in oakland the crosscountry travel certainly is going to be an added challenge
from there the ravens can get back on track with two of the next three games at home against the chicago bears and miami dolphins baltimore has a challenging road trip to minnesota in between those games
the ravens are trying to avoid missing the playoffs for the fourth time in five years harbaugh expects things to turn around he might be more optimistic than his fan base
weve been worse than 22 here before and come back and gone to the afc championship harbaugh said so thats what you do this is a long season in the national football league so we go to work

"__label__real european officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative
on wednesday margrethe vestager the european unions competition commissioner ordered luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros or about 293 million in unpaid taxes from amazon the ruling was tied to an agreement between the country and the company that the european commission the blocs executive arm said dated to 2003
the order resembles a similar move the commission made last year when it directed ireland to reclaim around 152 billion from apple
ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies in a sign of the disquiet in dublin about that order the irish government failed to meet a january deadline to collect the money it has appealed the ruling
that earned ireland a forceful rebuke from ms vestager
a year later ireland has not recovered any money not even in part she said warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid more conflictual waters a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle
although litigation to force ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid
at the time of the ruling europes competition watchdogs said that apples arrangements with dublin were illegal and had ensured the iphone maker paid virtually nothing on its european business in some years brussels argued that the deals allowed apple to funnel profit from two irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had no employees no premises no real activities
the irish department of finance said that it has never accepted the commissions analysis in the apple case and that it was taken aback by ms vestagers decision to take the country to court the department said it had made significant progress on this complex issue and accused the european authorities of taking a wholly unnecessary step

apple did not immediately comment on the latest move but has criticized the ruling in the past the original decision has also drawn the ire of the united states treasury department

in the case of amazon the commission said wednesday that luxembourg had reduced its tax bill for more than eight years from 2006 to 2014 and had conferred on the company a selective advantage the arrangement essentially capped the amount of tax that the retailer paid and relied on a method known as transfer pricing
typically transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location role in the overall company and assets but that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets like intellectual property are intangible the european commission said that amazon had abused this system by sending most of its european revenue to a luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax helping the company cut its overall bill
ms vestager said the arrangement had no valid economic justification and that the company had been able to avoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all amazon sales in the eu
amazon and luxembourg have denied the charges
we believe that amazon did not receive any special treatment from luxembourg the company said in a statement on wednesday adding that it paid tax in full accordance with both luxembourg and international tax law
amazon said it would study the commissions ruling and was considering whether to appeal
in a statement luxembourgs finance ministry also contested ms vestagers ruling as amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid it said
it is not illegal in the european union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates but as with amazons agreement with luxembourg offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to illegal state aid
the investigations are among several in which commission officials have looked into the affairs of silicon valley companies regulators in brussels are challenging google and qualcomm over alleged antitrust violations and officials in various countries have investigated facebook over its handling of customers data
ms vestager has made taxes a priority of her term as europes competition commissioner in that time she has penalized starbucks in the netherlands and anheuserbusch inbev in belgium but luxembourg has been a particular target in 2015 she told the country to claw back about 30 million from a fiat chrysler unit while a case considering luxembourgs treatment of mcdonalds is also continuing
advertisement continue reading the main story
i dont think that were done ms vestager said on wednesday adding that new laws were also necessary the main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job
a broader overhaul may be afoot the european commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes
a push in that direction could however prove complicated and carries several risks said clemens fuest the director of the ifo institute for economic research a prominent think tank in germany in particular european governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment while legislative changes at the european level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners
there are real dangers if brussels keeps acting unilaterally mr fuest said
the european union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis which forced many of the blocs member states to cut public services and raise tax rates but opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to lowtax countries"

the university of alaska fairbanks uaf was tasked with investigating how world trade center 7 fell on 911 the findings were livestreamed a few days ago the team found that wtc 7 did not fall due to fire contradicting nist who said the building collapsed from structural damages due to the fire
the presentation was presented by dr leroy hulsey hulsey spoke about the building its design as well as the methods the team used to determine their first of two conclusions the first part of the experiment is finished the uaf team found that wtc7 did not collapse due to fire the next part of the study is to map out the buildings structural systems response and what would have had to happen in order for it to fall down the report was published on thursday on the uafs website
the national institute of standards and technology nist opened an investigation into the collapses of wtc 1 wtc 2 and wtc 7 in august 2002 nist released its final report on wtc 7 in 2008 finding that the fires that were ignited by falling debris from wtc 1 caused the collapse of wtc 7 independent researchers however have assembled evidence that has raised profound questions regarding the notion that wtc 7 collapsed because of fire
the study was backed by architects engineers for 911 truth the researchers used a virtual model of the building to conduct the investigation
last year activist post talked to the director of strategy and development for ae 911 truth ted walter who is also in charge of working with the professor and raised the money to fund the wtc 7 evaluation walter previously told activist post that the project began in may 2015 and should wrap up in april of next year that deadline was passed but the study should wrap up in october according to the projects website
the reported failure was simulated using threedimensional finite element computer models of the building the research team studied the buildings response using two finite element programs abaqus and sap2000 version 18
three types of evaluations were performed
the planar response of the structural elements to the fires using wire elements the buildings response using the nists approach with solid elements and lastly the validity of nists findings using solid elements at the macrolevel progressive collapse ie the structural systems response to local failures is being studied using sap2000 with wire elements as well as with abaqus and it is near completion
the study concluded
the findings thus far are that fire did not bring down this building building failure simulations show that to match observation the entire inner core of this building failed nearly simultaneously the website for the study noted
the buildings structural systems response to local failures is being studied using sap2000 with wire elements as well as with abaqus and it is near completion according to the website for the study
former us congressional staffer susan lindauer a cia asset has previously said that she was told by her cia handler richard fuisz not to return to new york city in september of 2001 and that it would be far too dangerous to do so due to an imminent detonation of a miniature thermonuclear device
interestingly enough a peerreviewed scientific publication identified the presence of nanothermite in the wtc rubble one of the critical aspects of that paper has been confirmed by chemical engineer mark basile
a draft report of uafs current reevaluation will be released in october or november 2017 and will be open for public comment for a sixweek period allowing for input from the public and the engineering community with a final report to be published in early 2018 wwwwtc7evaluationorg noted

a very deep thinker
the tattoo across his chest reads against all odds
kaepernick was adopted a mixedrace baby raised by a white family the kaepernicks had two young sons who died because of heart defects they wanted another child
their boy grew up to become a superstar and one of the most divisive figures in the united states
at high school he was a brilliant baseball pitcher but the nfl was his focus he could throw the ball a quarterback
kaepernick posted this photo with his mum teresa with the caption she showed me how my heart was supposed to radiate love you
first he had to reach the college game it wasnt easy scouts from the university of nevada the only one to eventually offer him a scholarship watched the clips his older brother had burned to dvd but even they were not convinced
they took a gamble because they saw him dominate a highschool basketball game he really should have missed having been struck down with fever the same day
he went to college he studied for a degree in business management excelled on the pitch and opened his curious mind wide to the world
dr reginald stewart spent 19 years at the university of nevada and knew kaepernick during his time there
he told usa today he is very very smart and very intellectual hes a very deep thinker what hes doing is absolutely and directly in line with how hes always communicated
its not like i turned on the tv and was like wow where did this come from i was like you know what he has been thinking about these issues for at least the time ive known him at some point he made the decision that this was important enough for him to act
kaepernick is drafted by the san francisco 49ers in 2011 he leads them to the super bowl two years later but they lose to the baltimore ravens
he continues to read widely about the civil rights movement and postcolonial theory malcom xs autobiography and franz fanons the wretched of the earth
he begins to attend classes at the university of california berkeley having befriended ameer hasan loggins who is working towards his doctorate in african diaspora studies
in august loggins wrote an article for the athletic about their relationship he compared kaepernick to ella baker the civil rights activist who died in 1986 aged 83
she was a civilhuman rights leader that was invested in developing a leaderful movement loggins wrote she pushed the folks to politicise and mobilise the people via groupcentred leadership
here i am taking leadership cues from ella baker and next thing i know i am in the inner circle of a passionate intelligent and conscious nfl star with a tremendous heart and a righteous indignation over the treatment of the oppressed
i met kaepernick before he became a cultural icon and a lightning rod for both hope and hatred
people that trace our connection to uc berkeley assume he became politicised in my class but colin was aware focused wellread eager to learn
and then came three days in july last year
the perilous fight
the singer pauses hanging between verses he knows like the thousands standing around him in the stands on the pitch and on the stage that the starspangled banner the american national anthem is about to reach its highest point
kaepernick is on the team bench sandwiched between two giant softdrink barrels he sits alone as thousands roar and whoop in appreciation
i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour to me this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way he says after the preseason match in august 2016
there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder
kaepernick with his shirt number slightly obscured is by the orange drinks cart
this is not his first protest but it is his first protest in team kit and it is the first time he is asked about it
his silent solitary gesture of solidarity makes a lot of people very angry one of those is nate boyer he used to be in the us army special forces and is a former nfl player
when i saw that i felt like i was betrayed it just hurt it was extremely disgraceful for me in my eyes you might as well burn the flag he told the bbc
that was my initial reaction before i stopped and thought what is he so upset about that he would want to protest the symbol of what our country stands for which is freedom of rights
boyer decides to write an open letter to kaepernick and they meet
media playback is not supported on this device colin kaepernick has potential to be icon nate boyer
the nfl star in 2014 he signed a contract that would have been worth up to 126m 958m over six years actually sends a taxi to take boyer from san diego to san francisco about an eighthour drive along the california coast
i wanted him to stand but i wanted him to stand because he feels like we are going in the right direction like things are changing boyer says of their meeting
i wanted him to understand the implications of what he was doing and he listened that was important because we are at a time when people just shake their fists instead of trying to fix something together we reached a position of consensus
a week later kaepernick protests again this time he is joined by his teammate eric reid and both men kneel while the national anthem plays
boyer far right stands with his hand on his heart as the anthem plays kaerpernick kneels with teammate eric reid left
boyer stands next to them on the same night at another match jeremy lane of the seattle seahawks remains seated for the anthem the movement is growing
it took courage for him to sit initially it took more courage to bend his position a little bit boyer adds
i told him if they knelt i would be next to them with my hand on my heart because i support your right to peacefully protest in this country that is what i fought for
i guess that makes me a proud bitch
media playback is not supported on this device mr trump attacked dissenting players at a rally in alabama
in late september two matches in to the 2017 nfl season president donald trump makes a speech
he says players who refuse to stand for the national anthem are sons of bitches who should be fired by their teams
the reaction to his words could not be more divided
there is support from many who find the protest disrespectful and there is condemnation from many others
kaepernicks mother tweets i guess that makes me a proud bitch
nba star lebron james describes trump as a bum
over the weekend of 2425 september never before had the protest of refusing to stand during the national anthem attracted such attention scores of athletes managers and coaches across several sports performed some kind of protest or gesture of solidarity while the national anthem played before their games
some linked arms some stayed in the dressing room many knelt travis kelce of kansas city chiefs became the most prominent white player to kneel
i will be proud of it until the day i die he told bbc sport
hopefully it creates talk and creates change its very important for this to actually become a change in society instead of it just being a badge on nfl players for making a protest
but players find themselves having to explain what their actions mean
many nfl supporters and the us public in general view the players as being unpatriotic disrespectful of american values andor the us military and they agree with what trump said
media playback is not supported on this device chiefs fans divided over players kneeling
outside the stadiums fans tell the bbc
im 100 against it and 100 behind trump i dont come out to the football games to see political views this is not the venue for the protest i will boo them
they need to respect the flag
the message was never about the anthem the message is about police brutality against africanamericans and that seems to have been lost
eric reid who first kneeled with kaepernick a year before writes in the new york times it baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country flag and military personnel we chose it because its exactly the opposite
it has always been my understanding that the brave men and women who fought and died for our country did so to ensure that we could live in a fair and free society which includes the right to speak out in protest
but kaepernick himself is absent why
a prisoner of the moment
two nfl players walk into a computer game shop its not a joke this really happened
keith marshall and rob kelley of the washington redskins were in dulles just outside the nations capital when they saw a young boy wearing kaepernicks number seven san francisco 49ers jersey they complimented him on it
in conversation the 10yearold jaden explains why he is there he has been saving up for an xbox and is keeping tabs on the price he cant yet afford it
so they buy it for him with his grandmas permission of course
jaden explains why he has a kaepernick jersey
i liked how he wasnt afraid to show what he thought he risked getting fired which was a big thing i wouldnt even do that but he did and i really like him for standing out
i dont know if people agree with it but he just doesnt care what people say and thats inspired me and probably inspired other people
marshall and kelley also bought jaden a game but it wasnt madden the official nfl computer game
had it been jaden would not have found his favourite player kaepernick is no longer in the game in march he opted out of his contract with the 49ers he is now 29 years old and a free agent but off the pitch he is busy
his family is probably able to do whatever they want but not everybody is able to have the stuff that we have the luxury of having said kelley right
he has been donating money to various charities and projects across the united states he has pledged to donate 1m 750000 in total and has helped set up an educational campaign called know your rights
in late september sports illustrated published a front cover on how sport has united following trumps speech
there was no kaepernick there either
he is not injured and should still be capable of performing at the highest level he has not spoken to the media for months there are reports that team owners are refusing to sign him despite coaches wanting to
nba star steph curry was featured on the cover after he said he would not accept an invitation to the white house trump later said curry had been uninvited
colin kaepernick was not featured on the front of this months sports illustrated magazine
when he was asked about kaepernicks omission from the sports illustrated front cover curry described him as a prisoner of the moment
that was terrible he said the real people who are understanding exactly whats going on and whos really been active and vocal and truly making a difference if you dont have kaepernick front and centre on that somethings wrong
boyer who was there when kaepernick took a knee for the first time has not spoken to him for a while either not since the super bowl in february
he says that there was never any falling out as such but he does worry about him being pulled so far in one direction that there is never going to be any room to grow and really move forward
he believes kaepernick may never play again but adds i dont fear that because he is in a much more important position now
if he is able to embrace those who disagree with him and love them much like martin luther king did then colin has the potential to be something like that
he could be the face of something and really move this conversation forward if he is willing to listen
it is going to take swallowing of pride and humility but i would rather see him move into this realm than play again because he has been quiet for a long time
we need you to be a part of this because you started this

there are no better people to do it than stars he adds
there is social injustice in this country that we need to address and the guys in the nfl have a platform people listen to them

ware says kaepernick was definitely an inspiration and he hopes the influence of his kneel gesture will continue to grow
a lot of people are doing it now even the managers doing it too thats amazingly successful he adds
this will lead to better things open peoples eyes we need even more people doing what we doing everybody speak up please its not always about the football

beijing reuters chinas former ambassador to the united nations has taken up a new role as a deputy head of the countrys taiwan policymaking body the taiwan affairs office part of a leadership reshuffle connected to a key communist party congress opening next week
taiwan is one of chinas most important and sensitive issues china considers proudly democratic taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the possibility of using force to bring the island under its control
veteran diplomat liu jieyi served as chinas ambassador to the united nations from august 2013 until last month when he was recalled to beijing to await a new role
liu has now taken up the position as the top ranked of four deputy heads of the taiwan affairs office according to an updated list of the offices leadership positions posted on its website chinese media reported on the change on wednesday
while china considers taiwan to be an internal affair it is not unusual for chinese diplomats to serve in the taiwan affairs office
zhang zhijun remains head of the taiwan affairs office a position he took in 2013 replacing wang yi who currently serves as chinas foreign minister zhang also previously worked for the foreign ministry
as the top ranked deputy at the office liu stands in line to take over from zhang if he also assumes another position in the next few months
the onceeveryfiveyears party congress will see many people take up new posts between now and the annual meeting of parliament in march
taipeis relations with beijing have deteriorated sharply since president tsai ingwen leader of the proindependence democratic progressive party took office last year china suspects she wants to push for the islands formal independence a red line for beijing
china has cut off a regular dialogue mechanism with taiwan ramped up military drills around the island and stepped up international pressure to limit taiwans diplomatic footprint
tsai who has pledged to maintain peace with china said this week her government was still seeking breakthroughs in ties with beijing and promised consistent and stable policiesnl4n1ml1l8"

its fine baker said we have full confidence in tanner
and the cubs have reason to believe in their starter jake arrieta a former cy young award winner who skipped his last start of the regular season to rest a hamstring injury lately arrieta has been dominant he has a 228 era since the allstar game break
ive been able to throw a few really quality sides timing is really good the stuff is good arrieta said so the arm strength hasnt been affected and if theres any effect there i think its in a positive way just kind of giving it a breather not throwing for a few days and obviously the hamstring benefited from that as well so i think it could have been a blessing in disguise for us
the way things have gone for the cubs lately that would only be fitting last year cleveland had homefield advantage for the world series but it ultimately helped the cubs because kyle schwarber a lumbering slugger coming back from a knee injury had an extra game to be their designated hitter the cubs won three of the four games in cleveland

in left field on monday schwarber dropped and then kicked a daniel murphy fly ball in the sixth inning to set up the nationals first run the cubs simply shrugged it off they had no hits at the time off max scherzer but went on to win 21
there was no panic in the dugout said the cubs ben zobrist there was no thought that it wasnt going to happen it was just when is it going to happen when you make mistakes the mantra as a team is just so what 
the cubs went 9270 this season an 11game drop from last year and five games worse than their record in 2015 but the playoffs reset everything and the cubs look well prepared

no team has won consecutive world series titles since the yankees of 1998 through 2000 making this the longest stretch in major league history without a repeat champion the cubs president of baseball operations theo epstein said this spring that the biggest challenge for a defending champion is overcoming the physical toll on its pitchers from the previous postseason

but like the los angeles dodgers who will face the winner of this series in the nlcs the cubs did not have a single starter among the top 20 in innings pitched this year that could help their rotation handle the rigors of october better than most the cubs starter with the most innings jose quintana with 188⅔ arrived from the white sox in a trade for four prospects on july 13 more than two weeks before the nonwaiver deadline
he was going to have a lot of suitors did have a lot of suitors at that point said cubs manager joe maddon our guys did a great job of jumping the gun there a little bit and getting him because hes been really exceptionally important to us
quintana gave the cubs a proven starter who did not have to grind through the last postseason and who is under team control through 2020 he went 73 with a 374 era for the cubs then held washington to an unearned run over five and twothirds innings in game 3
starters have a ghastly 853 era in this postseason but the cubs trio of kyle hendricks jon lester and quintana has allowed one earned run in 18 23 innings for a 048 era and an average of more than six innings per start
if your starter can get you six seven innings into a game it takes a lot off your bullpen said hendricks adding later in this day and age were lucky to have the rotation we have and rely on that
the nationals boast a strong and durable rotation too but when the baseball gods dropped a gift in their laps on tuesday it squirted through their hands and shattered on the ground the cubs once played that hapless role but not anymore they expect the best in october and play like it too"
"__label__real keeping an active lifestyle with copd by meg watson was this helpful 47 
i have to confess i dont use my walker all the time i find that if im not trying to get anywhere too fast or not on my feet for too long i really dont need it sure im a little slower at everything i do now getting dressed is almost a chore but overall i consider myself a pretty healthy eightyeightyearold and a pretty busy one too
i go to an exercise class at the retirement community where i live twice a week and have found that this not only helps build strength in my legs but it builds the endurance in my lungs which is especially important for me because i have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd
i like to get dinner with friends and go on day trips with the other residents of my retirement community just recently i went on a bus trip to the cleveland art museum to see a special exhibit on impressionists painters for that trip i did bring my walker since we walked around the museum for about two hours i was tired and winded but not overly exhausted some days ill have lunch or dinner with my son bill who lives in town and about once a year i travel to minneapolis to visit my son jack and family

i started having breathing problems and experiencing shortness of breath in my midsixties after several bouts of pneumonia my primary care doctor sent me to a pulmonologist who gave me a chest xray did a pulmonary function test and several breathing tests they also stuck a tube up my nose for a bronchial biopsy to figure out what exactly was reducing my lung function ive been treating it ever since with an inhaler and the occasional overthecounter expectorant or stronger antibiotic at that time the doctor diagnosed me with bronchiectasis which is basically a ballooning in the bronchial tube that causes mucus to get stuck and pool there
last year i was hospitalized to drain some fluid that had gathered around my lungs after that my pulmonologist started referring to my condition as copd she put me on oxygen which now i only use while i sleep its not absolutely necessary to have my oxygen when i travel so leave it at home i will however request a wheelchair at the airport as hustling to find my way to my gate can cause my copd to flareup
ive been dealing with this condition for a little over 20 years and honestly i dont notice that its gotten much worse of course ive developed other issues with age like arthritis i do have some heart problems my doctors say i have atrial fibrillation a condition characterized by a rapid heart beat that often causes poor blood flow to the body its common among people with copd
most of the time i dont even notice my condition except i tend to get short of breath when i exert myself too much but it doesnt prevent me from doing all the things that i like to do exercising traveling to visit family and socializing with friends really as long as im checking in with my pulmonologist which is about every six months now and monitoring my overall health the copd doesnt bother me and i wont let it
im extremely grateful that i still live independently in my wonderful retirement community have family closeby and still get to do all the things i love

"__label__real for several days afterward those who fled were forced to stay in a different friends house each night said the cook who asked that he and his fiancée not be named because he felt their lives were still in danger
this kind of intimidation is not new in northern ireland nor does it appear to be on the rise around 30 people have declared themselves homeless for similar reasons each year for the past halfdecade according to statistics provided by the northern irish government and this years figure of 33 is no departure from that trend
but the recent episodes at cantrell close have made headlines in northern ireland because they occurred in a place that was intended to be a foundation stone for a postsectarian society it has also raised concerns about certain politicians commitment to the process of integration and about the ability of the northern irish police to curb the influence of sectarian paramilitary groups
this is a very good illustration of a much deeper problem said stephen farry a lawmaker from the alliance party which tries to bridge the divides between the provinces unionists and nationalist communities northern ireland is not yet a peaceful society we have ongoing coercive control by paramilitary structures at a local level across many communities
a recent stroll down cantrell close a tiny tshaped culdesac did not make this instantly obvious at first sight it was a picture of prim docile suburbia 41 twostory homes each with a tidy lawn and a garden fence lined a quiet road with a shiny bike rack at one end and a speed bump at the other the tensions became apparent only when you looked toward the sky
flying from some of the lampposts were the flags of the ulster volunteer force or uvf a banned terrorist group that killed more than 400 people during the northern irish troubles mostly targeting catholics and irish nationalists or those opposed to northern ireland remaining part of the united kingdom
no faction has claimed responsibility but the police believe that the threats came from people purporting to be part of the uvf two men have been questioned in connection to the crime on suspicion of membership in the group
advertisement continue reading the main story
the east belfast community initiative which says it mediates on behalf of former uvf combatants said the uvf was not involved cantrell close meanwhile is just one of many streets in east belfast lined with the groups flags
photo
on cantrell close itself there appears to be an informal omertà in place of those who answered their doors on a recent afternoon none would discuss the threats to their former neighbors
one man even claimed he knew nothing at all about the situation his mouth curling into a faint smile
some outside the neighborhood have been more outspoken however about a culture of impunity that they believe encouraged whoever made the threats

before moving in residents of cantrell close signed pledges against the display of controversial flags the government also says it is illegal to fly the flags of terrorist groups
yet when the uvf flags suddenly appeared in june no action was taken either to find the perpetrators or to remove them creating the impression that sectarianism would be tolerated even at such a symbolic housing development
the police who youd expect to lead didnt said mairtin o muilleoir a lawmaker from sinn fein an irish nationalist party and the gangs were emboldened
local unionist politicians were also perceived to take too weak a stance back in june
ill always be cautious about causation and correlation said cillian mcgrattan a politics professor at ulster university but the reaction of politicians from the democratic unionist party or dup to sectarian episodes during the summer including the cantrell close issue really left a lot to be desired he added
asked for comment emma littlepengelly one of the party lawmakers facing criticism said she had been clear in june about her opposition to paramilitary flags she and a dup colleague also issued an immediate condemnation of last months threats to catholic residents
advertisement continue reading the main story
belfasts top policeman meanwhile suggested that the flags had not been deemed problematic enough to justify their removal back in june
the reality is that while we understand the publics frustration in this matter police will only act to remove flags if there are substantial risks to public safety chief superintendent chris noble said in an emailed statement
the flags were taken down only several days after the threats were made
for the young cook and his fiancée these explanations mean little they feel frustrated at the authorities for doing nothing in the first place to remove the flags which they said were clearly intimidating they feel abandoned by the police for failing once the threats were made to provide a permanent presence on the street
and they fault the housing authorities for failing to quickly find them alternative accommodations and for assuring them that the street was safe to move to
the cooks fiancée a 20yearold waitress said officials should have recognized her vulnerability as a young mother with a newborn in tow before encouraging her to move in
politicians like mr o muilleoir hope the episodes at cantrell close will not derail plans for more integrated housing projects in europe in 2017 we either let an armed gang dictate policy he said or we step things up
but for the targeted families themselves the integration dream is over from now on the cook said his family would stick to neighborhoods with a catholic majority"

"__label__real image copyright hasitha tudugalle image caption the whitefaced heron an innocent victim of alleged voting fraud
new zealands bird of the year poll has been hit by votefixing claims for the second time in three years
the prestigious and some would say heated competition is run by the countrys forest and bird organisation and has run into controversy just three days after its launch newshub reports
it appears that one unnamed christchurch citizen has been flouting the one person one vote rule by setting up 112 email accounts to cast votes for a certain avian variety
wellingtonbased scientist yvan richard spotted the apparent fraud using a program that he had previously used to follow elections i noticed there was a big spike for the whitefaced heron at about midnight on the first day of voting so i let forest and bird know he said
forest and birds kimberley collins said measures have now been put in place to prevent it from happening again were not mad just impressed that someone cares enough about new zealands native birds to rig the competition she told new zealand herald
but as stuffnz reports the poll is splitting households in new zealand where it has become a fractious political birdfight
if you pick a dumb bird you have to have a think about what that says about you one voter who disagreed with his partners vote for the kereru wood pigeon said
bird is the word
its not the first time that the bird of the year competition has made national headlines due to fraudulent voting in 2015 two teenage girls owned up to creating fake accounts to vote for the kokako radio new zealand reported at the time
in response forest and bird invited the sisters to take on some voluntary work for the organisation to atone for their behaviour
bird of the year has become a vehicle that raises awareness of the fragility of new zealands ecosystem where a third of native bird species are at risk of becoming extinct through imported predators and the destruction of their habitats
this years competition which closes on 23 october sees the kea the parrot dubbed clown of the mountains well ahead in the voting
speaking of the fraudulent whitefaced heron enthusiast which now has just 63 votes ms collins says she hopes they can see the error of their ways
we do hope the weight of their conscience will prompt them to make a donation to our appeal she tells radio nz

due to travel ill only have time for ol scoring this week i encourage you to listen to the ol podcast at the bottom of this article or here for a broader discussion about the offense
offensive line scoring
the ravens ran 66 scored snaps versus the steelers excludes accepted penalties which result in no play kneels spikes and special teams plays that result in a run or pass
stanley ronnie scored better despite giving some ground in the pocket ronnie was backed up in a manner similar to what we have seen in past years from rick wagner but much of that was directed at the back pylon of the pocket where flaccos ability to step into a throw was not impeded despite proximity he surrendered 3 pressures 2 heyward 1 watt all of which came on bull rushes he had 1 block in level 2 1 pancake and did not register a highlight the ravens didnt run much in this game but i am concerned he may not be right physically to provide the good leads in level 2 weve seen on fast developing plays in the past
scoring 66 plays 60 blocks 3 missed 3 pressures 54 points 82 per play thats a b with or without adjustment
hurst james reversed a downward trend of games with his best outing of the season he allowed 2 run penetrations 1 on a level2 whiff on shazier q1 1415 and another on a whiffed pull on tuitt q1 1213 but recovered to play well thereafter he made 2 blocks in level 2 but did not have a pancake or highlight more common on run plays
scoring 66 plays 57 blocks 5 missed 2 penetrations 1 pressure 51 points 77 per play after adjustment thats a b at guard
jensen ryan took a step back from his careerbest game against the jags he was beaten right by heyward for half a sack charge q2 1120 shared with allen and eluemunor dupree beat him on a stunt for pressure q2 022 and hargrave beat him left for a pressure q3 612 he had 3 blocks in level 2 1 pancake and no highlights
scoring 66 plays 58 blocks 2 missed 13 penetration 25 pressures ½ sack 4933 points 75 per play after adjustment thats a c at center
skuraeluemunor matt skura mas not nearly as effective in his second start eluemunor was party to 4 negative events in just 16 snaps it appears the staff would like to get jermaine some live fire because hell be starting if there is another injury at any of the 5 ol positions by either direct substitution or shuffling skuras biggest individual event was being bulled by heyward for 23 of a sack charge q3 320 he also surrendered full pressures to both heyward and tuitt on the plus side he made 3 blocks in level 2 converted both pulling assignments and had 2 highlights including a very nice pancake of shazier on a pull in level 2 q2 719
scoring for skura 50 plays 43 blocks 2 missed 1 penetration 25 pressures 23 sack 32 points 64 per play with adjustment thats a d at guard
scoring for eluemunor 16 plays 10 blocks 2 missed 13 penetration 1 pressure ½ 13 16 sack 433 points 27 per play thats too few snaps for a grade 20 is the minimum
scoringcombined 66 plays 53 blocks 4 missed 133 penetrations 25 pressures 117 sacks 3633 points 55 per play thats an f with or without adjustment
howard austin did a decent job vs dupree but shazier was too quick for him tuitt overpowered him watt beat him once and heyward beat him for part of a penetration tuitt beat him for portions of 2 sacks on the same drive q3 320 and q4 1455 as is often the case slow feet increase the chances for holds and he was guilty of an infraction against shazier on the games final drive q4 042
scoring 66 plays 55 blocks 4 missed 133 penetrations 1 pressure 1 13 23 sack 1 offensive holding 3833 points 58 per play thats another d after adjustment i reduced his adjustment to 02 because he could have done more to bump hilton further past the pocket and give flacco a little more time on the dbs sack to be clear howard got no portion of a sack charge on that play because flacco had 35 seconds to throw

"__label__fake america has a shady past of treating people who were considered the others with disrespect and violence do you think that whats happening now to the muslims is new do you think it only happened to africanamericans in historys past if so you should read on and learn your history something worth sharing with your friends
 
italianamericans the largest mass lynching in us history took place in new orleans in 1891 and it wasnt africanamericans who were lynched as many of us might assume it was italianamericans
 
 america has a proud tradition as an immigrant nation but it also has a long history of marginalizing those it marks as other americas other heritage includes suspicion hostility abuse and even death leveled against ethnic groups as they arrived one after another in waves over the past 2½ centuries
 
i learned much about this as i researched the family corleone a novel i wrote based on a screenplay by mario puzo the novel is about among other things italianamericans living in new york during the depression
 
there were a number of things that surprised me in my initial research i knew something about our nations early antipathy toward catholics and italians but i had not fully appreciated the depth of that antagonism for example the largest mass lynching in us history took place in new orleans in 1891 and it wasnt africanamericans who were lynched as many of us might assume it was italianamericans
 
after nine italians were tried and found not guilty of murdering new orleans police chief david hennessy a mob dragged them from the jail along with two other italians being held on unrelated charges and lynched them all the lynchings were followed by mass arrests of italian immigrants throughout new orleans and waves of attacks against italians nationwide
 
what was the reaction of our countrys leaders to the lynchings teddy roosevelt not yet president famously said they were a rather good thing the response in the new york times was worse a march 16 1891 editorial referred to the victims of the lynchings as sneaking and cowardly sicilians the descendants of bandits and assassins an editorial the next day argued that lynch law was the only course open to the people of new orleans 
 
john parker who helped organize the lynch mob later went on to be governor of louisiana in 1911 he said of italians that they were just a little worse than the negro being if anything filthier in their habits lawless and treacherous
 
in addition to prejudice based on ethnicity italian immigrants also had to face an older hostility toward their religion in earlier centuries catholics in america were in a position similar to todays muslims in 1785 when catholics proposed building st peters church in the heart of manhattan city officials fearing the papacy and sinister foreign influences forced them to relocate outside the city limits in this incident its easy to hear echoes of the murfreesboro protests as well as the ongoing protests against an islamic center proposed for 51 park place in contemporary manhattan
 
on december 24 1806 two decades after st peters was built on church street where it still stands protesters surrounded the church outraged by mysterious ceremonies going on inside ceremonies we now commonly understand to be the celebration of christmas the christmas eve 1806 protest led to a riot in which dozens were injured and a policeman was killed
 
the decades go by they turn into centuries and we forget weve forgotten the depth of prejudice and outright hatred faced by italian immigrants in america weve forgotten the degree to which we once feared and distrusted catholics if we remembered i wonder how much it might change the way we think about todays immigrant populations or our attitudes toward muslims
 
the question of prejudice toward italians and catholics was ancillary to my writing project something i wanted to better understand in order to fully imagine my characters nonetheless the research left me with even greater respect for generations of italian catholic immigrants who struggled to make their way in a world so initially hostile to them and to their religion and by extrapolation for all immigrants and members of minority faiths everywhere in every historical period including our own who face similar struggles
 
the antigerman crusade a minnesota minister was tarred and feathered when he was overheard praying in german with a dying woman
 
during world war i many german americans were broadly accused of being sympathetic to the german empire without regard to their individual loyalties former president theodore roosevelt was one of the most significant voices in this national suspicion denouncing hyphenated americanism and insisting that dual loyalties were impossible to maintain in times of conflict this wartime xenophobia spread throughout the united states in the form of community scorn and organized state and government repression
 
antigerman fervor during world war i resulted in the renaming of food that was of german origin or that simply sounded german sauerkraut became liberty cabbage frankfurters were called hot dogs and salisbury steak was given a less gastronomically pleasing but more americanized label meat loaf streets and even some municipalities with german monikers changed such as the renaming of the michigan town of berlin to marne in honor of those who fought in the allied victory at the first battle of marne
 
in early september congress passed a bill requiring all germanlanguage newspapers published in the united states to print english translations of any commentary about us government policies and international relations or the state or conduct of the war the same rule was applied regarding any other nation with which germany was at war
 
while thousands of german immigrants were forced to buy war bonds to prove their loyalty to the united states they were rewarded with widespread xenophobia from national organizations as well as from their neighbors the red cross barred individuals with german last names from joining for fear of sabotage the cincinnati public library was asked to withdraw all german books from its shelves in much darker examples of bigotry fueled by the war germanborn robert prager was dragged from a collinsville illinois jail and lynched by a mob who suspected him of spying while a minnesota minister was tarred and feathered when he was overheard praying in german with a dying woman
 
language was a major fear factor driving the antigerman hatred and manifested itself in legislation that attempted to isolate foreignlanguage practitioners in the 1918 babel proclamation the governor of iowa prohibited all foreign languages in schools and public places nebraska barred instruction in any language except english although the us supreme court ruled the ban illegal in the 1923 case of meyer v nebraska the response by german americans was often to americanize their names eg changing schmidt to smith or müller to miller and to limit their use of the german language in public places especially churches
 
in anticipation of support for germany among immigrants president wilson issued two sets of regulations on april 6 and november 16 1917 imposing restrictions on germanborn male residents over the age of 14 including natives of germany who had taken citizenship in countries other than the united states approximately 250000 men were required to register at their local post offices and carry registration cards at all times as well as report any changes of address or employment the regulations were extended to women in april 1918
 
the us government investigated thousands of people under these regulations and eventually arrested approximately 6300 aliens allegations included spying for germany or endorsing the german war effort internees were held at two camps splitting the eastern and western united states along the mississippi river fort oglethorpe in georgia and fort douglas in utah while most internees were released in june 1919 some remained in custody through march and april 1920
 
while germany was at war with france and britain beginning in august 1914 america had not yet joined the conflict yet there were several german military vessels in us ports that were ordered to leave or be detained the crews of these ships were first held as alien internees and later as prisoners of war
 
when war broke out in europe hundreds of men on two german cruisers the prinz eitel friedrich and the kronprinz wilhelm were unwilling to face the might of the british navy in the atlantic and instead lived for several years on their ships in various virginia ports and frequently enjoyed shore leave eventually they were given a strip of land in the norfolk navy yard in norfolk virginia on which to erect accommodations
 
in october 1916 the ships and their personnel were moved to the philadelphia navy yard along with the structures which became known locally as the german village yet the village was still located at a secure us military facility surrounded by barbed wire in the spring of 1917 nine detainees escaped prompting us secretary of the navy josephus daniels to transfer the other 750 residents of the village to secure units at fort mcpherson in georgia and fort oglethorpe separated from the civilian internees there
 
in december 1914 the german gunboat cormoran attempted to refuel and restock its provision at the american island territory of guam denied the full amount of fuel needed the german captain optioned to remain in guam along with the crewmen as alien detainees most of the crew lived on board due to a lack of housing and relations remained friendly even though the german seamen outnumbered the islands contingent of us marines
 
as a result of german uboat attacks on american shipping the united states broke off diplomatic relations with germany in february 1917 us authorities in guam imposed greater restrictions on the german detainees as relations between america and germany worsened following the us declaration of war against germany in april 1917 americans demanded the immediate and unconditional surrender of the ship and personnel the captain and crew destroyed the cormoran with an explosion that took several german lives the surviving 353 german sailors were shipped to the us mainland as pows on april 29 1917
 
irishamericans racism and the pursuit of whiteness irish were to negative stereotyping that was very similar to that of enslaved africans and african americans the comic irishman happy lazy stupid white negroes
 
like many immigrant groups in the united states the irish were characterized as racial others when they first arrived in the first half of the 19th century the irish had suffered profound injustice in the uk at the hands of the british widely seen as white negroes the potato famine that created starvation conditions that cost the lives of millions of irish and forced the outmigration of millions of surviving ones was less a natural disaster and more a complex set of social conditions created by british landowners much like hurricane katrina forced to flee from their native ireland and the oppressive british landowners many irish came to the us
 
once in the us the irish were to negative stereotyping that was very similar to that of enslaved africans and african americans the comic irishman happy lazy stupid with a gift for music and dance was a stock character in american theater drunkenness and criminality were major themes of irish stereotypes and the term paddy wagon has its etymological roots in the racist term paddy a shortening of the name patrick which was used to refer to the irish however this is also a gendered image and refers to irish men specifically the masculine imagery of paddy hides the existence of irish women but did not protect irish women from racism as they were often more exposed to such racism through domestic jobs women typically played a key role in maintaining catholic adherence which resonates closely with irishness and difference the model minority if you will stereotype of irishamerican women is of a bridget recognized for her hard work and contribution to irish upward class mobility
 
simian or apelike caricature of the irish immigrant was also a common one among the mainstream news publications of the day much like the recent new york post cartoon for example in 1867 american cartoonist thomas nast drew the day we celebrate a cartoon depicting the irish on st patricks day as violent drunken apes and in 1899 harpers weekly featrued a drawing of three mens heads in profile irish angloteutonic and negro in order to illustrate the similarity between the irish and the negro and the supposed superiority of the angloteutonic in northern states blacks and irish immigrants were forced into overlapping often integrated slum neighborhoods although leaders of the irish liberation struggle in ireland saw slavery as an evil their irishamerican cousins largely aligned with the slaveholders
 
and following the end of slavery the irish and african americans were forced to compete for the same lowwage lowstatus jobs so the white negroes of the uk came to the united states and though not enslaved faced a status almost as low as that of recentlyfreed blacks while there were moments of solidarity between irish and african americans this was short lived
 
over the course of the 19th and early 20th century irish americans managed to a great extent to enter and become part of the dominant white culture in an attempt to secure the prosperity and social position that their white skin had not guaranteed them in europe irish immigrants lobbied for white racial status in america although irish peoples pale skin color and european roots suggested evidence of their white racial pedigree the discrimination that immigrants experienced on the job although the extent of the no irish need apply discrimination is disputed the simian caricatures they saw of themselves in the newspapers meant that whiteness was a status that would be achieved not ascribed
 
for some time now irishamericans have been thoroughly regarded as white evidence of this assimilation into whiteness is presented by mary c waters harvard in a recent ajph article in which she writes that the oncerigid lines that divided europeanorigin groups from one another have increasingly blurred waters goes on to predict that the changes that european immigrants ahve experienced are becoming more likely for groups we now define as racial while i certainly agree that the boundaries of whiteness are malleable it is a racial category that expands and contracts based on historical cultural and social conditions i dont know if it is malleable enough to include all the groups we now define as racial others
 
as people rush to embrace even fictive irish heritage and encourage strangers to kiss me im irish today take just a moment to reflect on the history of racism and the pursuit of whiteness wrapped up in this holiday

"__label__real shanghai reuters china said it plans to accept data from overseas clinical trials to speed up approvals of drugs a potential boon for international drugmakers as well as patients who often face lengthy delays for new medicines to reach the market
the move outlined by the cabinet late on sunday seeks to address high medicine costs and access to healthcare for chinas population of nearly 14 billion in the past 15 years china has approved just over 100 innovative new drugs about onethird the number in developed markets
accepting overseas clinical data will help global drugmakers at time of growing competition from chinese rivals in the worlds secondbiggest pharmaceuticals market as well as pressure from authorities which are anxious to rein in prices
overall chinas support for scientific innovation with drugs and medical devices is lacking and the quality of products on the market still falls short of top international levels the draft proposals said
we must speed up the examination and approval of urgently needed drugs and medical devices
the cabinet also said it would look to improve the protection of medical intellectual property and boost the number and quality of clinical trial testing centers in china the proposals contained no timeline for implementation
we want to make our drug industry largescale and strong make it more competitive and shift our longterm reliance on imports of new drugs wu zhen deputy head of the china food and drug administration told a briefing on monday
some drugs have been used overseas for 67 years before making it to market in china wu added
china in march proposed ways to speed up approvals for imported drugs including reforming clinical trial requirements it also wants to boost its own drug industry and see a shift from generic drugs and towards more innovative medicines and medical equipment

"__label__real scott pruitt administrator of the us environmental protection agency answers a question during the concordia summit in manhattan new york us september 19 2017 reutersjeenah moon rc1a105cb430
washingtonnew york reuters the head of the us environmental protection agency said on monday he would sign a proposed rule on tuesday to begin withdrawing from the clean power plan former president barack obamas centerpiece regulation to fight climate change
heres the presidents message the war on coal is over epa administrator scott pruitt told a gathering in the kentucky coalcountry town of hazard
green groups criticized mondays announcement and praised the plan a collection of emissions standards for us states that the obama administration imposed to reduce pollution from power plants the largest emitters of greenhouse gases by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030
no matter who is in the white house the epa is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution and the clean power plan is an achievable affordable way to do that said sierra club executive director michael brune
but trade organizations like the national association of manufacturers which participated in a legal challenge to the plan praised it
this regulation was broader than what the law allows said nam vice president ross eisenberg at the same time we recognize the need for a policy to address greenhouse gas emissions
the effort to undo the plan is part of a broader target of the administration of president donald trump to revive the coal industry and boost domestic fossil fuels production the epa now says the clean power plan introduced by obama in 2015 was illegal
pruitt said the obamaera plan gave the government too much influence in the competition to generate power in the united states
jim matheson chief executive of the national rural electric cooperative association an electric utility group agreed he said ending the plan would take pressure off some cashstrapped utilities that still relied on coalfired power plants but he said market forces were already moving utilities away from coal
total power generation by coal among the nrecas members fell from 71 percent in 2014 to 62 percent in 2016 matheson said
the epa has not decided whether it will replace the clean power plan according to a draft of the proposal seen by reuters on friday or whether or when it will propose a new rule to regulate emissions from existing power plants but the agency said it would soon solicit information on a potential replacement

"__label__real stockholmlondon reuters us scientists jeffrey hall michael rosbash and michael young won the 2017 nobel prize for medicine on monday for unraveling molecular mechanisms that control our internal body clocks
these help explain how people experience jet lag when their internal circadian rhythms get out of sync while also having wider implications for disorders ranging from insomnia to depression to heart disease
chronobiology or the study of biological clocks is now a growing field of research thanks to the pioneering work of the three scientists who explained the role of specific genes in keeping fruit flies in step with light and darkness
today scientists are exploring new treatments based on such circadian cycles including establishing the best times to take medicines and there is an increased focus on the importance of healthy sleeping patterns
this ability to prepare for the regular daily fluctuations is crucial for all life forms thomas perlmann secretary of the karolinska institute nobel committee told reporters
this years nobel prize laureates have been studying this fundamental problem and solved the mystery of how an inner clock in our bodies can anticipate daily fluctuations between night and day to optimize our behavior and physiology
rosbash said the news that the trio had won the nobel prize which is worth 9 million swedish crowns 11 million was a little overwhelming
it took my breath away literally i was woken up out of deep sleep and it was shocking he told reuters
its great for basic science it hasnt had a tremendous amount of practical impact yet so its really a very basic discovery its good to have the attention on this kind of basic work
hall most recently of the university of maine collaborated with rosbash while they both were at brandeis university in waltham massachusetts they split the prize with young of rockefeller university in new york city
scientists were already pondering the concept of body clock genes in the 1960s and 1970s
michael w young c a joint winner of the 2017 nobel prize in physiology or medicine walks to a press conference at the rockefeller university in new york us october 2 2017 reutersshannon stapleton
then in the mid1980s the three laureates used fruit flies to isolate a gene called period that controls the normal daily biological rhythm and showed how it encodes a protein called per that accumulates in cells during the night and degrades during the day further research revealed the role of other genes in the complex system
we were hopeful what we did in the fly would pertain more widely young said in news briefing at rockefeller university on monday but added that it has unfolded in a way that just couldnt be imagined at the beginning
young said the trio could not have anticipated that the whole system could be revealed in their lifetimes but new scientific tools helped accelerate the work
just like puzzle pieces the genes fell out and the way they work together provided this beautiful mechanism that we now appreciate

their discoveries help explain how plants animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm to be in synch with the earths revolutions
before youve got the genes everything is a black box michael hastings of the mrc laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge england told reuters once youve got the genes everything is possible
scientists now understand that body clocks influence alertness hunger metabolism fertility mood and other physiological conditions and researchers have begun to study the implications of erratic sleeping and working patterns or children who stay up late
we are learning more and more what impact it has to not follow your clock nobel committee member christer hoog told reuters if you constantly disobey your clock what will happen medical research is going on with regards to that
medicine is the first of the nobel prizes awarded each year the prizes for achievements in science literature and peace were created in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman alfred nobel and have been awarded since 1901
nobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as alexander fleming the discoverer of penicillin and karl landsteiner whose identification of separate blood types opened the way to carrying out safe transfusions
the prize has not been without controversy especially with the benefit of hindsight such as the 1948 award for the discovery of ddt a chemical that helped battle epidemics but was later banned due to its harmful environmental impact

listen again to rugby union an injury crisis the full programme
the statistics have been piling up at the start of this rugby season 10 of the 12 premiership clubs suffering a combined 82 injuries to firstteam players one of them wasps beginning october with 15 players out injured pro14 side dragons going into this weekend with 24 players on the sick list
it may turn out to be a freakish blip a cruel upsurge in a sport where the number of professional players injured has been relatively static over the past eight years the rugby football unions annual injury audit in the new year should tell us more
for now for those on the front line it is about more than numbers this is the story from those living through it the coach missing half his team the international player who wakes up in pain but keeps coming back for more the rugby obsessive forced to retire young the doctor who tries to patch them up and keep them going
all still cherish the sport none are complaining if it sounds like a strange type of love affair this is how it works and hurts
the player who keeps going id never say youre 100 fresh
dan cole has won 74 caps for england and been on two lions tours
tighthead prop dan cole has been capped 74 times for england been on two british and irish lions tours and made more than 200 club appearances for leicester tigers and bedford blues
he is a man who relishes the brutal forces and challenges of playing in the front row a stoic who missed most of 2014 with a neck injury that left him with no power in his left arm but has come back to keep playing past his 30th birthday what follows is neither a grumble nor hyperbole
you struggle to get a good nights sleep after a game on a saturday afternoon because your ears hanging off or your shoulders hurt you get to three oclock on a sunday and you start feeling worse normally monday is the worst day for stiffness tiredness pain said the 30yearold
what hurts most depends which way youve been lying but usually youll have a stiff neck or a stiff shoulder youre creaky in your lower limbs but you still get going you have to get going usually by thursday youre close to 95 id never say youre 100 fresh
the pain bonds you as a team you learn about each other in the tough times whether thats the physical tough times or the mental ones the emotional times from that you get a deeper learning of each other a deeper trust of each other
i do think about what it will be like when im 50 or 60 we were laughing in the dressing room today about what our reunion in 30 years time will look like
its a harder game now than when i started its physically tougher there are more collisions the skill level is higher the conditioning is higher
to us its all worth it because we love what we do you accept how youre going to be because youve enjoyed what you do you prefer that to sitting at a desk for 50 years
my grandfather worked down a coal mine the seam collapsed on him and he broke his back he was left injured by his job and i will possibly have the same consequences but i enjoy my job a lot more than he enjoyed his so its a payoff
the big one you fear is a spinal injury everything else in your career touch wood whether its knee ligaments or shoulders surgery and medicine are so good that they can fix that in six or nine months spines brains the neural stuff those are the ones you dont wish on anyone
there are times when you get rolled up at the bottom of things or when youre clearing someone out of a breakdown and maybe your foot gets trapped and youre rolled back or youre over the ball and you think uhoh theres a moment when you know for a flash second that you could be in trouble
then your foot springs loose its over and you dust yourself off and you get on with it you get two or maybe more a season like that when you think im glad i came out of that unharmed you check yourself over and then you run off because theres something else to be done
you accept it as part of the game if you dwell on it it will affect you for longer and youll probably expose yourself more to those sort of things its like if you go on an advanced driving course and youre told that if youre skidding out of control and you look at the crash youre going to go into it but if you look away from it youll be ok
the career cut short its like a big anvil being dropped on you
will fraser was forced off with a head injury against munster in 2014
the relentlessly positive will fraser won the european cup and premiership double with saracens and after being called into the england squad as a 23yearold appeared set for a long and successful career
instead after a series of injuries including tearing a tendon off the bone in his shoulder damaging knee ligaments a slipped disc a bleed on the spine and 10 subsequent operations he went to his surgeon in april this year to receive his final diagnosis he does not regret anything that happened to him
i had become best mates with all these consultants who were experts in different areas of the anatomy there was a pub round the corner from the surgeons office so me and my physio had a pint to discuss various outcomes said the 27yearold
we went in to the surgeon and he said what he said its the realisation but at the same time youre fighting every urge to accept it even though in the back of my mind i probably knew i was still trying to fight it
its not really until youre given that black and white news by someone else because if it was up to me id still be giving it a go to have a surgeon a topofhisgame surgeon say to you this isnt going to get better its time to call it a day is like a big anvil being dropped on top of you
we went back to the pub had a few more pints and i didnt really say very much it was just my physio being a good bloke and telling me there were better things coming in my life then i went home and basically broke down in front of my missus
noone else among the saracens players really knew the gravity of where we were i had purposely tried to keep it away from the lads as much as possible because were a very tight group
i even kept it away from my superclose friends like jamie george owen farrell jackson wray and george kruis because i didnt want them to worry these are guys ive grown up with who ive seen every day since i was 14
for a week or two it was all very surreal i was still in and around the club for a couple of weeks having to keep it secret from my teammates when i finally told the team i was genuinely worried i wouldnt be able to get any words out i was blubbering away waterfalls streaming down my face
i just wanted to thank them people have always asked me with the injuries how are you able to come into training with a smile on your face when youre not playing and i said to the boys the reason i was able to do that is because i was coming in to see you guys im doing something i love with people that i love
i pop down to the training ground once a week to get my fix of seeing the lads and getting some banter thrown my way for my work bag and its like ive never left which is obviously brilliant and exactly how you want it to be but equally they then go out and train and im inside sending some emails and it hits home every time that youre not doing it
the coach missing half his squad a crisis in the sport at the moment
wasps were without an entire xv including flyhalf danny cipriani because of injury
bernard jackman is the genial head coach of dragons he currently has 24 players out injured which equates to 48 of his squad
he is also a former hooker for leinster and ireland
a threeyear medical study in france found that hookers are more likely to be injured than any other position suffering more face neck and knee injuries than anyone else on the team
there seems to be a crisis in the sport at the moment and its not just our club it seems to be getting worse said the irishman
the most important meeting of the week for me is the monday morning one when you get the assessment of what happened in the weekends game from your medical staff and who is likely to be available for the weekend ive started dreading those meetings now
it affects the quality we can train at were looking to create a style of play and if the opposition in training arent of the quality were going to get on saturday it gives you a false sense of confidence we dont get tested enough the ball isnt in play enough when we do our defensive systems
i plan now that for any given match im going to be missing about 30 of my players most coaches are facing that at the moment i think 20 missing would be decent at the moment youd be happy with that nobodys escaping from this
my own knees are shot im not great first thing in the morning my knees do get very sore if im on my feet for long but i wouldnt change any of it im still doing my passion
for 21 years i have been a professional player or coach and im still loving it hookers carry quite a bit of ball defensively youre making more tackles trying to catch up with the flankers but its a great position to play if my son wanted to play hooker i certainly wouldnt try to talk him out of it
i was never worried about the future its great at the time and its always shortterm can i play this week can i play next week you worry about postplaying afterwards and if you dont have that attitude you wont have a long career
jamie roberts harlequins centre said the only time youre not injured is your first game and i think thats right theres very rarely a day when youre not hurt and you just crack on
for the vast majority of injuries you can train and play for sure there are days they cant get out of bed but as you warm up and the day gets longer and you get the adrenaline into your body you can play through that
its the love of the game its the competitiveness its the sense of teamship a job to do to represent your club your region your country your family in a positive way that 80 minutes on a saturday gives you back more than the pain takes away during the week
that feeling of emptying yourself over 60 or 80 minutes brings contentment theres nothing like it there is something cleansing about it something wholesome
the doctor on the front line very few are playing injury free
french club pau stood down former all black colin slade after he suffered three concussions last season
highly regarded sports doctor eanna falvey was head of medical for the british and irish lions this summer having been team doctor to the irish rugby team for many years and munster before that
a former irish amateur heavyweight champion he understands both the physical pain of elite sport and its addiction
its a harsh reality but very few players are playing injury free at any given point in time anything from a slight muscle strain to tightness in a joint to aggravation of an old injury he said
sometimes it can be difficult if a player has a cruciate ligament repair well generally see within four or five years that theyll have some degenerative change within the joint a player will be managing but over time their knee will be getting sore not acute but regularly bothering them
it becomes a case of managing pain but you have to avoid the quick fix of them coming to you for pain relief thats very rarely a good idea all youre doing is glossing over the underlying issue
during matches at the 2011 world cup the time for the doctor to run out make contact with the player and make an assessment youre talking 30 seconds maximum
theres a very rudimentary assessment where you ask the player five questions i can say as a team physician i never got through the five questions without being interrupted by something or someone while i was trying to do it i would have argued that thats not a long enough time to even decide if youre worried about somebody
youre trying to make an assessment with 80000 screaming supporters youre probably cold and wet there are five minutes left in the game your team is just about to win or lose these are all things that shouldnt make a difference but they do
when the pressure is on that can be a lonely place to be most pitches have a significant camber so if youre on one touchline you often cant see the feet of players on the other side of the pitch there is so much going on at any one time that you spend the whole match watching who does get up and who doesnt get up rather than whats happening in the match
i remember being with ireland in rome and exireland wing luke fitzgerald called me over hed felt a little shudder in his knee he had actually ruptured his cruciate he was standing up he was trying to jog around to him it just felt a little wobbly a bit unusual you couldnt have chosen a more benign cause but it was a devastating injury
it can be hard you become reasonably friendly with these players i teach a masters in sports medicine to doctors and physios and one of the things i teach them is that you cant afford to be a fan
you cant afford to be emotionally invested in the outcome of either the team or the players input on the team you need to look after the player as a human being rather than part of the team
during two games for his new club leicester this season george ford often the smallest man on the pitch made a combined 29 tackles he has made 63 in all after six premiership matches the most by any back
the aftermath bending over to get into the bath is a genuine struggle
ugo monye made more than 200 appearances for harlequins on the wing as well as winning 14 caps for england and two for the lions
now part of bbc radio 5 lives rugby union weekly podcast he is a little less flexible than he used to be
every morning i get up walk down the stairs and i struggle it takes me 20 to 30 minutes to warm up my achilles
im 34 i had a groin reconstruction about four or five years ago ive got tendonitis in both my achilles ive got three prolapsed discs in my spine
weve got a new baby at home my paternal duty is bathing phoenix bending over to get into the bath is a genuine struggle i cant actually bend over to pick her up
and this is coming from a winger i wasnt a number eight who had the huge collisions and competed at the ruck"

"__label__fake blackhawks roster breakdown goalies
before its news
with opening night less than a week away the blackhawks are down to some tough decisions with their roster we talked at length about the options on tuesday nights shoutcast but there are some real questions im going to break down some of the upcoming roster decisions or at least try to lay them out in a logical manor this doesnt mean joel quenneville decide to use the logical method first we look at my favorites the goalies which is the only position that is seemingly locked down
corey crawford is the clear and unquestioned number one he had has his injury bugs each year but he is still a top 10 goalie in this league we can all expect another injury at some point this year it is inevitable crawford will continue his solid unspectacular performance and continue to be overlooked as well as under rated he wont truly be appreciated until the cup window is secured shut and this generation of players are retired it is a shame that the guy gets so much angst from fans that dont truly understand the intricacies of the position but it is the nature of the sport and chicago
sneaky offseason acquisition anton forsberg will back up corey crawford before camp began i honestly thought that jeanfrancois berube had a solid chance to challenge forsberg for the backup job but berube had a pretty rusty performance against the blue jackets this opened the door wide open for forsberg all he needs to do is be solid tonight in detroit and the race is officially over forsberg really impressed me in his opening game vs the blue jackets he was big in net quick in the crease and composed his reflexes are very good for a big guy i am now aboard the forsberg train if he can keep this up hell be a perfectly fine replacement for scott darling
my dark horse this camp was jeanfrancois berube and he simply just didnt deliver in his one opportunity his first goal against was more the lack of support from his team but he got a piece of the ryan murray shot the last two goals against were pretty sloppy there is no excuse to be giving up a goal off the end boards from virtually behind the net like he did to lucas sedlak the third goal was a weak backhand less than a minute later by oliver bjorkstrand that was actually defended alright by brent seabrook which softly went 5hole he will be fine in rockford if he sneaks through waivers and should be the number one guy there but jeff glass is a former teammate of new coach jeremy colliton so that could affect the game distribution if crawford or forsberg get hurt berube is a fine option as well
jeff glass is just a veteran depth guy that can be a leader in the locker room for the kids and provide some valuable consistent experience in the icehogs backup role if glass ends up being counted on for more than a leadership role then there are real problems
first year pro and puckin hostile favorite collin delia doesnt figure into the pro teams plans this year or even maybe next but this will be an important season for him to earn a reputation and gather some crucial experience expect him to probably start the season in indy with the fuel and share time with matt tomkins if delia can have a solid season in indy we could see him get some time in rockford as the season progresses he has the potential and certainly has the talent the fanboy in me wants to see delia get some rockford time and wow the pants off everyone but the pragmatist in me says that isnt realiztec to expect
matt tomkins is signed to an ahl deal and will eventually end up in indy with delia while i was certainly fine with jake hildebrand and eric levine in the echl last year delia and tomkins are an upgrade to the depth of the organization hildebrand was just alright as the primary netminder in indy but was overmatched in the few times he actually saw the ice in rockford he today signed a tryout with the tulsa oilers of the echl levine was a temporary solution to the thin goaltending depth in the organization as was jeff glass and wasnt even all that good in indy

traffic is bad in the county if we have to evacuate people itd be better to have you already out of the area if you have a place to go go he said

scores missing
derek southard has been worried about his 71yearold father daniel since he heard sunday that fires were blazing through northern california
southard 29 lives with his father in santa rosa california but he was at a wedding in monterey on sunday while his father was at home
i had been texting him that day at the wedding i told him im call him that night and then he never called me back southard told cnn in tears he texted me at midnight and asked if i was having fun at the wedding i guess the fire came an hour or two after that
when derek southard got back to santa rosa on monday the neighborhood was still closed off he called the sheriff and asked him to go have a look
the sheriff said his house was burned to the ground and his car was melted in the driveway but ive still got my fingers crossed that he made it out somehow he wrote in a plea on facebook on tuesday
derek talked to his nextdoor neighbors who told him that they barely got out they said they didnt have time to knock on his dads door
authorities believe communications issues are preventing many of the missing from checking in with relatives
among the dead were a couple who relatives said had known each other for nearly 90 years charles rippey 100 and his wife sara 98
they died shortly after the atlas fire now one of the largest at more than 42000 acres began sunday night engulfing their home near the silverado country club north of napa napa county spokeswoman kristi jourdan said
this house was one of the first ones hit in the subdivision their son mike rippey told cnn affiliate kpix on tuesday
the couple met each other in grade school in wisconsin and began a family together after charles served in world war ii the son told kpix they relocated to california after living in the midwest and on the east coast he said
the son said he believed his father was trying to save his mother when the fire struckfrom where they found his body he was trying to get from his room to her room he told kpix he never made it there is no way he would have left without her
elsewhere in the county part of a veterans home in yountville near napa was evacuated tuesday night over fears of approaching flames but the fire changed directions so the rest of the residents will stay put for now napa mayor jill techel said only the most frail those in a nursing facility left the property in the initial evacuation techel said

"__label__real when asthma gets scary meditation and relaxation practices by marijke vroomen durning rn

asthma touches so many peopleif you dont have it yourself theres a good chance you know at least one person who does according to the national institutes of health more than 25 million people in the united states have been diagnosed with asthmaand there are likely many who endure its symptoms wheezing coughing shortness of breath but havent been diagnosed
managing the attacks
asthma is a chronic respiratory or lung disease caused by inflammation of the small airways symptoms usually begin in childhood but adults can develop asthma later on in life it cant be cured but you can usually manage asthma with medicationsmost often inhalers or puffers however people with asthma may be able to reduce how often they have an attack called exacerbations with some simple lifestyle changes these wont eliminate the attacks completely but they can make a difference
medical reviewer william c lloyd iii md facs last review date jan 19 2016 2017 healthgrades operating company inc all rights reserved may not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from healthgrades operating company inc use of this information is governed by the healthgrades user agreement
so what kinds of activities are we talking about the obvious ones are to avoid triggers such as cigarette smoke and allergens and to be careful when suddenly exposed to cold winter air participating in physical activity is good for people with asthma but you should speak with your doctor about what type of exercise is best for you especially if you have exerciseinduced asthma
another lifestyle change that is getting more popular is relaxation exercises and meditation this is because emotional and psychological stress affects us physically for some people with asthma stress can make symptoms worse
different types of meditation
meditation means different things to different peopleno one method is better than another it all boils down to what works for you you can learn most of these methods on your own in classes or with individual instruction instructionclass or individualis often a good idea at first especially with the more physical practices like yoga
instructors can help you learn the proper poses with the right techniques helping reduce risk of injury instructors can help you pace yourself through the meditative processes coaching you and encouraging you as you learn the new techniques
here are a few examples
guided meditation or guided imagery often described as a vacation for your mind guided meditation or imagery may a good place to start in your meditation journey choose an image that is pleasing either a fond memory or an imaginary place then imagine being there bringing to mind the sounds smells and sensations of the memory or place once youve practiced this it becomes easier to call on those sensations when anxiety comes over you
mindfulness meditation mindfulness is a way of saying being in the moment its a form of meditation that brings you to the here and now what you smell feel hear and more by practicing mindfulness and concentrating on what is happening at that moment you can pull on your inner resources when you feel stressed anxious or depressed
yoga yoga is seen in many ways from a form of gentle exercise to meditation in this case you can use yoga as a way to help calm your body and your mind as you meditate and relax some people get more out of the physical aspect of the practice while others benefit from the breathing and meditation side
tai chi tai chi is an ancient martial art but unlike the ones most people may be familiar with like karate tai chi is gentle and slow allowing you to focus on your body and your thoughts practitioners consider it meditation exercise although you are constantly moving nothing is forced or rushed and your body is kept in a relaxed manner throughout
living with a chronic illness like asthma can be stressful by learning a few basic relaxation or meditative techniques you may be able to reduce that stress which may also lessen the frequency and severity of your asthma

although the entirety of the western corporate media machine is worthy of the name fake news cnn has become the standard bearer of the title it seems that the organization is doing everything in its power to earn its position as the tip of the spear in the army of fake news indeed it is scarcely possible to keep up with the lies deceit and halftruths cnn presents to the general public on a daily basis occasionally however one instance stands out so much that it cannot be allowed to slip by without being addressed
back in 2016 as aleppo was the scene of a fierce battle between americas terrorist forces and the syrian military cnn broadcasted a report from jibrin syria where it purported to show the sad state of civilians fleeing the war that had come to aleppo the clip shows two syrians one young boy and an older man who are telling the reporter about their situation
the cnn reporter predictably attributes the horrors facing the civilians as a result of the eastern part of aleppo being under siege by the syrian military not the fact that terrorists had seized east aleppo and were fighting to the death to keep it still he quotes an older man who paints a less than typical cnnstyle portrayal of the rebels the man says i wanted to leave with my kids fifteen days ago but the rebels shot at me and said hey you bastard do you want to join the regime
the only thing surprising about the mans statement was that it was actually aired on cnn
however the most interesting aspect of the report is what was attributed to the young boy whom cnn quotes as saying we were afraid that we would starve to death we were also scared because heavy bombs were falling
this quote makes the boy seem as if he is worried because of the syrian militarys bombs however the translation is not only inaccurate the second half is completely fabricated the boys actual statement is we were afraid that we would starve to death we were afraid that we would starve to death even to a nonarabic speaker one can clearly hear that the boy is merely repeating his first statement a second time he says nothing about bombs cnn simply added it to the translation for political and propaganda purposes
while civilians on the ground were no doubt worried about the bombs of the syrian military bombs kill regardless of who drops them they were even more afraid of living under the unimaginable tyranny of americas terrorists still cnn has gone much further than simply bending the truth to fit a narrative it has obviously told a complete and total lie it has put words in the mouths of its interview subjects and passed it off as the truth at best this is a violation of journalistic ethics more realistic however it is an act of willful deceit and an attempt to mold the minds of the general public for political purposes
at this point cnn cannot be taken seriously as even a second rate news organization it is clearly nothing more than a propaganda mouthpiece for state department and other interests unfortunately for cnn even operating as a propaganda organ it is only second rate

"__label__real nairobi reuters kenya lurched deeper into political confusion on wednesday as a court ruling and a parliamentary vote appeared to ease uhuru kenyattas path to a second term as president a day after his chief rival quit an election they were to contest
kenyatta and raila odinga were due to face off in a repeat election on oct 26 after the supreme court annulled their august ballot in which the president was declared the winner
but odinga pulled out of the rerun on tuesday fuelling doubts about whether it would be contested at all wednesdays interventions by the judiciary and legislature added to the uncertainty
as police used teargas to disperse opposition protesters demanding electoral reform the high court approved a petition by ekuru aukot who polled less than 1 percent in the august vote to contest the second ballot
the election board later issued a statement saying that all eight candidates who competed in august would be on the ballot it also said although odinga had notified them of his withdrawal by letter he had not yet submitted the official form to do so
the developments suggested that the second election would go ahead with kenyatta the likely winner against a plethora of weaker candidates no challenger except odinga polled more than 1 percent
further muddying the political waters parliament passed an election law amendment stating that if one candidate withdrew from the rerun vote the remaining one would automatically win the vote was boycotted by opposition lawmakers
the law aimed to ensure kenyatta could be declared president if he faced no challengers
the events stoked confusion among voters and fears that politicallydriven violence might escalate months of political uncertainty have already blunted growth in east africas richest nation a longtime ally of the west
theres a real atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty there seems to be dozens of opinions of what should come next said murithi mutiga a senior horn of africa analyst for the global thinktank international crisis group
unease
justifying his pullout on tuesday odinga said the election would not be free and fair and renewed calls for the electoral board iebc which he blamed for the procedural irregularities identified in the first ballot to be replaced
opposition supporters on wednesday renewed their protests for electoral reform
a supporter of kenyan opposition national super alliance nasa coalition carries a banner depicting kenyan opposition leader raila odinga during a protest along a street in nairobi kenya october 11 2017 reutersbaz ratner
demonstrators lit bonfires in kisumu an odinga stronghold in the countrys west while more than a thousand supporters marched through the central business district in the capital nairobi police used teargas to disperse them in both cities witnesses said
juliana otieno the chief executive of the oginga odinga hospital in the city said 17 people had been admitted with injuries suffered during the protests a reuters witness counted at least five of them with bullet wounds
kisumus police commander titus yoma said he had no information on the bullet wounds and his officers were still quelling the protests which were centered around two slums in the lakeside city
at least 37 people were killed in protests immediately following the august vote almost all of them by police a kenyan rights group said on monday ethnic clashes killed 1200 people following a disputed presidential poll in 2007
we want a reformed iebc said elisha odhiambo an opposition legislator referring to the electoral board which has frequently relied on riot police dispersing protests outside its offices in recent weeks

mombasa governor ali hassan joho a key opposition player told protesters in uhuru park our voices must be heard we have no war with anyone but we will not allow anyone to stifle us
after the high court ruling in his favor aukot told reporters that he still had concerns about the board and would issue a statement in a day or two giving clarity about his plans
it was unclear if other candidates from the first ballot with little support would also seek to be included but the election board said it still had time to print ballot papers
the sept 1 supreme court judgment that nullified kenyattas 14 million vote win also stipulated elections had to be held within 60 days
if that schedule is not met the constitution provides for the speaker of parliament a member of kenyattas party to take power
with two weeks to go until the elections it is still unclear who will stand
i would expect one of the parties will try to seek an authoritative announcement from the supreme court international crisis groups mutiga said

"__label__fake the new goosebumps movie trailer is out and it has all the monsters you could want
 
 
if you grew up in the 90s you are probably more than familiar with the franchise goosebumps well now there is an upcoming movie based on these nostalgic books that brings all the old monsters to life
 
the trailer for the film was released on wednesday and seems to almost have a jumanji type vibe jack black plays a fictional version of the writer of the series rl stine stine gets a new neighbor next door that hopes to win the heart of stines daughter in doing so he accidentally releases all of the horrifying monsters locked inside stines original manuscripts
 
from there it seems to seem like jumanji like i was saying earlier they all must capture the monsters that have escaped by forcing them back into the book
 
being that i loved these books as a kid ill defiantly give it a chance but whos to say itll be good it might just be another lame attempt at remaking something that was already amazing the references to monsters so far though include
 
the abominable snowman of pasadena
 
my best friend is invisible
 
the giant praying mantis from a shocker on shock street
 
the werewolf of fever swamp
 
why im afraid of bees
 
the plant from stay out of the basement

im a joe girardi fan please note i love mr t as well and think the world of him as a person and i believe gi joe is the better skipper no he is not good with the media no he isnt flashy nope he aint even a born bred new yorkerya know what he is an outstanding manager and a big reason the yankees are where they are
joe torre was a genius at keeping talented high priced inflated egos in check but he was always getting those type of players he had the core 4 in their prime he saw the best bronx bomber team since murders row winand win and win and win howd he do before king george hired him to replace buck who like him or not did a lot of heavy lifting to build the yankees howd he do when he went hollywood joe was great for the yankeesbut he isnt the manager girardi is if you are letting go the pinstriped blinders for a minute and being honest with yourself i think you may see what im saying
photo getty images
yankee fans have a way of taking the glory years and making them seem untouchable joe torre was good joe girardi is better he backs up his guys he knows the game you can take a walk with all the binder nonsense joe is a brilliant guy you dont graduate from northwestern with an engineering degree because you had a library card and a pulse joe knows baseball more than you doyep even you you sitting on your couch watching the game ready to tweet your displeasure with the yankee skipper because he gave the starter the hook and went to betances joe knows how to develop kids dont agree

"__label__real washingtonnew york reuters president donald trumps administration on friday undermined requirements under the obamacare law that employers provide insurance to cover womens birth control keeping a campaign pledge that pleased his conservative christian supporters
new rules from the department of health and human services will let businesses or nonprofit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the laws mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no copayment
conservative christian activists and congressional republicans praised the move while reproductive rights advocates and democrats criticized it it was unclear how many employers would actually drop birth control coverage on religious grounds and there were significant doubts that many big ones would
within hours the american civil liberties union sued the administration in federal court in san francisco to try to halt the rule claiming among other things that it violated the us constitutions requirement for separation of church and state
the states of massachusetts and california also sued and democratic state attorneys general in another 16 states threatened legal action
this is a landmark day for religious liberty under the obama administration this constitutional right was seriously eroded republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan said
the trump administration just took direct aim at birth control coverage for 62 million women planned parenthood federation of america president cecile richards said
with this rule in place any employer could decide that their employees no longer have health insurance coverage for birth control richards added
trump who criticized the birth control mandate in last years election campaign won strong support from conservative christian voters the republican president signed an executive order in may asking for rules that would allow faithbased groups to deny insurance coverage for services they oppose on religious grounds
the contraception mandate was implemented as part of the 2010 affordable care act democratic former president barack obamas signature legislative achievement trump and republicans in congress campaigned against obamacare as the law is known but could not get enough votes to repeal it as they had promised
in its reasoning for the move the administration said among other things that mandating birth control coverage could foster risky sexual behavior among teens and young adults it overturned the obama administrations view that the birth control requirement was necessary to meet the governments compelling interest to protect womens health

this administrations contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision top house democrat nancy pelosi said
the administration broadened narrow existing religious exemptions to include an exception on the basis of moral conviction for nonprofit and forprofit companies
federal rules implemented under obamacare required employers to provide health insurance that covers birth control but religious houses of worship were exempted some private businesses sued regarding their rights to circumvent such coverage and the supreme court ruled in 2014 that they could object on religious grounds
alienating potential shareholders
supporters of contraception rally before zubik v burwell an appeal brought by christian groups demanding full exemption from the requirement to provide insurance covering contraception under the affordable care act is heard by the us supreme court in washington us march 23 2016 reutersjoshua robertsfile photo
case western reserve university school of law professor jonathan adler said it was unlikely publicly traded companies would seek exemptions why would a publicly traded company risk alienating potential shareholders by taking such a step adler said
ellen kelsay chief strategy officer at the national business group on health a lobbying group for large companies said most large employers have provided coverage for birth control prior to any mandates and we expect most will continue to do so irrespective of any exemptions that may become available
according to one estimate only 3 percent of nonprofit groups offering health benefits have objected to contraceptives coverage
hhs has issued a balanced rule that respects all sides it keeps the contraceptive mandate in place for most employers and now provides a religious exemption said mark rienzi one of the lawyers for the little sisters of the poor the order of roman catholic nuns which runs care homes for the elderly had challenged the mandate in court
the little sisters and other christian nonprofit employers objected to a 2013 compromise offered by the obama administration that allowed entities opposed to providing contraception insurance coverage to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage
the justice department released two memos that will serve as the governments legal basis for justifying the rule and laying out a framework for how apply religious liberty issues in legal opinions federal rules and grant making
in another decision popular with trumps evangelical supporters the justice department on wednesday reversed federal policy and declared that federal law banning sex discrimination in the workplace does not protect transgender employees trump also has removed protections for transgender students and moved to ban transgender people from the military
trumps support among evangelical voters a major force in his 2016 election victory remains strong but has been slipping in line with his overall approval ratings according to recent reutersipsos poll results

"__label__fake passing game film review mcfrown week 3 dolphins
before its news
welcome to the second part of our film breakdown as we look at the bad plays from this past game the jets won and the offense performed relatively well so this article is short as mentioned in the comments discussing the previous thread this series is going to be shorter on words from here on out lets look at the issues on offense this past week
1
this is a sack early in the game where mccown fails to step up in the pocket instead choosing to evade towards the sideline and ultimately getting sacked there are receivers open down the field and an emergency option in the running back coming out of the backfield the qb should have stepped up in the pocket on this play
2
this is a completed pass but nevertheless a bad pass austinseferian jenkins makes a really good play on the ball for the catch otherwise its going towards the defender the play call has a tiered option as well and mccown makes the right choice but he has to throw a better pass than this to be consistently successful
3
the play most likely should have ended up with a penalty on either the offensive or defensive player the pass is underthrown and this is borderline placement in the bad throws department anderson gets pushed off the route which slows him down and the ball ends up slightly under thrown if anderson wasnt interfered with he would have ran just a bit further down the field which would make this pass severely under thrown very good play call otherwise as there are multiple options around the field
4
josh mccown makes a good read but a horrible pass the play set up on this pass is great as the qb reads the reaction of the linebacker if the linebacker stays with the tight end the ball is thrown in the flat to the running back if the linebacker breaks through to go towards the running back as he does on this play then hit the tight end for an easy pass everything works except for the throw
5
mccown misses a wide open crossing route to start this play and then does a good job of eluding defenders in the pocket and finding free space the running back does a great job of running down the field instead of blocking leaving him wide open for a pass all mccown has to do is pass it to the wide open running back and this is a major completion but the quarterback doesnt take the pass instead he gets hit hard by the defender and goes down
6
the jets get aggressive here and go for a td but mccown throws this pass right into double coverage he doesnt see the linebacker dropping back from the middle to take away the route and the jets are lucky this pass falls down for an incomplete pass
conclusion
the jets offense looked markedly better than at any point this year during the dolphins game it wasnt a game without faults but they did a good job of limiting their mistakes and taking advantage of the defense which seemed to play timid all game long
grade b

sao paulo reuters french energy conglomerate engie sa engiepa has appetite for more brazil acquisitions and will evaluate assets being sold by eletrobras despite spending more than 1 billion in a licensing auction last week engies local unit head told reuters on wednesday
brazils statecontrolled utility eletrobras or centrais elétricas brasileiras sa elet5sa said on monday it will soon kickstart its divestiture plan which includes stakes in dozens of projects mostly wind parks and power transmission ventures
we are open to opportunities but always conservatively and with financial discipline mauricio bahr engie brasils chief executive said in an interview in sao paulo but our debt in brazil is low so we have some room
we would have to look asset by asset bahr said adding transmission lines could be of interest
brazils power sector is going through a process of consolidation with many local players putting assets up for sale to cut debt as credit is tight brazils government has tried to attract foreign capital to help boost the economy by selling operating licenses for several projects
engie spent 353 billion reais 113 billion last week in a governmentsponsored auction to win licenses to operate two large hydroelectric power plants in brazil
the assets will boost local operations which already contribute 18 percent to the companys global results
engie and eletrobras are partners in several projects including the massive jirau hydroelectric dam a plant built in the middle of the amazon jungle with capacity to generate 3750 megawatts
eletrobras has hinted it could sell stakes in its large amazon plants besides jirau it is a shareholder in belo monte and santo antonio dams
i dont know if they eletrobras will want to sell jirau it depends on their appetites but eventually it will be natural for the partners who have the right of first refusal to end up exercising it bahr said"

i dont think rush wants to do tv at all but oreilly and bolling do but it may be awhile before eric is ready to jump back in after the recent loss of his son
the imaginary new offering could probably pull in jenna lee as a known news anchor and perhaps some other upandcoming news talent from local stations to keep it from being all opinion shows steven crowder gavin mcinnes and michelle malkin might be interesting on panels or as cohosts but im not sure they have the chops to host an hourlong show on their own
stefan molyneux is entertaining and educational in his podcasts not sure about tv host though maybe
would also be cool if they entertained the idea of bringing in mrcs brent bozell to cover the media and joe bastardi for weather similar to how fox uses janice dean
contributors should include james woods charlie kirk nigel farage scott adams buck sexton katie pavlich dan bongino allen west larry elder dennis miller and nick gillespie

before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
keep in mind that at this point in the season any pitcher can be scratched at any time for any reason when looking for a streaming option you have to be careful and monitor the news and situations closely but with that thought in mind lets take a look at a few streaming options over the final two days of the season
saturday september 30
jake junis kansas city royals vs arizona
cbs sports 48 espn 189
if you look at junis overall 439 era and 129 whip you arent going to be very impressed though he has a split that needs to catch your attention
home 349 era
road 503 era
arizonas offense also isnt impressive on the road with a 395 slg 23rd in the league and 233 avg 28th in the league while hes not guaranteed a win things seem to lean in junis favor for a strong outing to finish up the season
sunday october 1
daniel mengden oakland as at texas
cbs sports 25 espn 388
mengden wasnt as impressive as he has been in his last outing but he still owns a 193 era in four september starts and will take on a texas offense that is hitting 231 in september he is tentatively scheduled to face off with cole hamels but theres talk that hamels wont take the mound and that will further strengthen mengdens case likely giving him a better shot at a win
anibal sanchez detroit tigers at minnesota
cbs sports 13 espn 44
over his past three starts sanchez has allowed 4 er over 180 ip with 25 k vs 5 bb in the process the twins will have nothing to play for instead likely resting their regulars as they prepare for their wild card matchup with the way hes pitching and that in mind sanchez has a good chance to finish his season on a high note

a group of senior wales players including gareth bale has urged manager chris coleman to stay on after his contract ends in november
wales hopes of qualifying for the 2018 world cup in russia ended with a 10 defeat by the republic of ireland in cardiff on monday
coleman 47 said after the game that he was not thinking about his future having previously said this would be his last campaign
he was been in charge since 2012
wales have not qualified for a world cup since 1958 although they reached the semifinals of euro 2016
defender chris gunter said everyone in wales fans and players would want to see him stay on 100
hes been a massive part of what weve done and he is the man to hopefully take us forward
if the powers that be can give him a really good contract and make him stay he can carry on being the greatest welsh manager of all time
chris coleman guided wales into the euro 2016 semifinals
asked about his future former fulham boss coleman said im genuinely not thinking about it theres a dressing room full of devastated players and staff
if you look at the makeup of our squad and the age of the squad some of the young ones coming through this is a good group of players even better for tonight
defeat hurts but you learn a lot from defeat you learn about yourself first and foremost
the whole nation will be mourning and disappointed again that elusive world cup has passed us by
wales who needed to beat the republic of ireland to qualify for the playoffs suffered their first defeat since the 20 loss to portugal in the euro 2016 semifinals
but james mccleans goal secured victory for the republic and sets up a twolegged playoff against one of the other group runnersup in november
meanwhile wales are lining up a friendly in november with mexico or the united states possible opponents
coleman added theres a chance i can stay and a chance i wont i cant give an answer right now
its not just a matter of signing a new contract the faw has been great with me i asked them to leave me alone as my contract has been running down and all the questions were getting asked
i wanted to concentrate on getting results therell be a conversation in due course
right now im thinking about the experience ill go back to my family and take a bit of time when the dust settles well see where we go
i think he will walk away
former wales striker john hartson on bbc radio 5 live
only chris coleman can answer the question over his own future i think he will walk away now
i do not think he will be short of offers he will be lined up for a big job if that is what he wants

"__label__real catch the wonder list on cnn saturdays at 9 pm etpt starting october 7
cnn the law of the jungle which never orders anything without a reason forbids every beast to eat man
i still remember the first time i read the passage from the jungle book heart racing beneath my pajamas covered with the six million dollar man
the real reason for this is that mankilling means sooner or later the arrival of white men on elephants with guns and hundreds of brown men with gongs rockets and torches then everybody in the jungle suffers rudyard kipling wrote
bill weir travels to india to learn why spotting a tiger in the wild could become a thing of the past
i probably understood that tiger attacks were fairly rare in milwaukee but to my 11yearold brain kipling was dropping wisdom that just might keep me alive on the next expedition into the weedy lot behind piggly wiggly
the reason the beasts give among themselves is that man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him
reading that passage 35 years later while rolling through the very forest that inspired the classic the irony in that line finally clicks
when we hear the woof of a frightened deer and my guide kills the engine my grownup heart pounds once again
it is a sign that there may be big cats nearby
i wonder who will be the last person to see a tiger in the wild and are they alive today
these are the questions that launched this stop on the wonder list and they led us to a much bigger question about life in the 21st century is the planet still big enough for man and maneater
find out how local conservationists are fighting to protect tigers when bill weir and the wonder list visit india
india is about onethird the size of the continental united states with four times as many people that kind of human pressure has changed kiplings law of the jungle in dramatic ways
according to the animal conservation group born free there are more tigers in cages in texas than in the forests of india
so i set out to understand how and why having covered the poaching of african animals to feed the huge market for asian medicine i assumed the demand for tigerskin rugs in dubai or tigerbone wine in beijing would be the biggest threat to this endangered cat
but it turns out that tigerhuman conflict is a much bigger problem almost half a billion rural indians have no plumbing and answer natures call by squatting in the forest most tiger attacks happen when these people are mistaken for prey and most tiger kills come in the angry hours that follow as friends and neighbors of the victim seek revenge
and so a new specialty in conservation is the art of tiger conflict mediation it is not easy to convince a frightened farmer that the cat that ate his cow is more valuable alive than caged or dead
a mission to photograph tigers turns into a battle of wills with a group of monkeys part of the wonder lists behind the shot with philip bloom
but these efforts along with a more pointed antipoaching campaign seem to be paying off the latest tiger census counted 2226 big cats in india a 30 increase over the previous count in 2011 if the estimates hold this would make india the only country in the world with a growing tiger population"

washington reuters israeli intelligence officials spying on russian government hackers found they were using kaspersky lab antivirus software that is also used by 400 million people globally including us government agencies according to media reports on tuesday
the israeli officials who had hacked into kasperskys network over two years ago then warned their us counterparts of the russian intrusion said the new york times which first reported the story nytims2yev8vj
that led to a decision in washington only last month to order kaspersky software removed from government computers
the washington post also reported on tuesday that the israeli spies had also found in kasperskys network hacking tools that could only have come from the us national security agency wapost2i2clxa
related coverage germany no evidence kaspersky software used by russians for hacks
after an investigation the nsa found that those tools were in possession of the russian government the post said
and late last month the us national intelligence council completed a classified report that it shared with nato allies concluding that russias fsb intelligence service had probable access to kaspersky customer databases and source code the post reported
that access it concluded could help enable cyber attacks against us government commercial and industrial control networks the post reported
the new york times said the russian operation according to multiple people briefed on the matter is known to have stolen classified documents from a national security agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer which had kaspersky antivirus software installed on it
it is not yet publicly known what other us secrets the russian hackers may have discovered by turning the kaspersky software into a sort of google search for sensitive information the times said
the current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules the times said
the newspaper said the national security agency and the white house declined to comment as did the israeli embassy while the russian embassy did not respond to requests for comment
the russian embassy in washington last month called the ban on kaspersky lab software regrettable and said it delayed the prospects of restoring bilateral ties
kaspersky lab denied to the times any knowledge of or involvement in the russian hacking kaspersky lab has never helped nor will help any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts the company said in a statement on tuesday
eugene kaspersky the companys cofounder and chief executive has repeatedly denied charges his company conducts espionage on behalf of the russian government
the company issued a statement saying that as a private company kaspersky lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government including russia and the only conclusion seems to be that kaspersky lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight the washington post reported the company does not possess any knowledge of israels hack the post cited the statement as saying

the bayern munich forward said it hasnt been an easy decision but i am 33 and now must give my full focus to my club
robben made his debut in april 2003 and won 96 caps scoring 37 times
he is joint fourth on the netherlands alltime goalscorer list level with former arsenal forward dennis bergkamp
his dinked penalty and 20yard shot put the dutch 20 up early on against sweden on tuesday night but the netherlands needed to win by seven clear goals to overtake sweden and take second place
robben was part of the squads which finished third at the 2014 world cup and lost the 2010 final to spain"
"__label__real the lack of help called into question whether the american military is providing enough resources for troops undertaking dangerous missions in africa the vast remote stretches in which american special forces operate are inherently dangerous because of their inaccessibility and are conducive to ambushes said brig gen donald c bolduc who until june commanded special operations forces on the continent
photo
its not the end of the earth but you can see it from there he said its tough tough stuff to operate in
had the american special forces been in iraq or afghanistan american or allied aircraft and medical evacuation helicopters would have been minutes away the result of experience from two long wars and contingency plans tested by american wounded and dead
the pentagon defended its commitment to the golden hour across the globe
the department puts vast resources against that problem lt gen kenneth f mckenzie jr the director of the militarys joint staff told reporters last week it is one of the primary considerations for each geographic combatant commander
he added whenever possible we seek to achieve that goal
but the militarys africa command asked lawmakers broadly for more help months before the attack in niger a west african nation nearly twice the size of texas
africa lacks a theater distribution network to support our forces the command said in a statement to the senate armed services committee in march noting it has about 1000 troops operating across a ninenation region of west africa this capability gap forces our personnel to revert to costly and ineffective ad hoc solutions
american commandos deployed to the region have joked darkly that their commands inability to get them out of harms way has boiled down to one directive do not get hurt a special operations forces member who had deployed to central africa recently and oversaw planning for medical evacuation procedures for his unit said that if anyone on his team was wounded they could ideally count on being evacuated in 10 hours other military officials said that the reality was that the waits for help were multiples of the onehour goal in active war zones like iraq and afghanistan

general bolduc said that when he took command more than two years ago many american troops on the continent were operating in such remote locations that they fell well outside even that expanded time frame for emergency medical evacuation calling the militarys evacuation capabilities at the time immature

some troops however argue that the golden hour is unrealistic for elite forces deployed far afield and in some cases prevents them from carrying out more risky but important missions
youre never going to have the golden hour in africa its not possible general bolduc said in a telephone interview but you have an acceptable amount of time that commanders have agreed on
for security reasons he would not disclose the time frame in africa
in the past africa command has said that it relies heavily on contract searchandrescue aircraft and that african partners lack the capability and capacity to assist with personnel recovery missions
working closely with his higher headquarters at africa command as well as with the air force and such foreign partners as the french general bolduc said he was able to increase air and ground medical resources including available aircraft and left an acceptable emergency evacuation response in place by the time he departed over the summer
general bolduc said he was not surprised about the hostile activity in southwest niger about 120 miles north of niamey the capital he said the militants assault may be a sign of the increased effectiveness of mali chad niger burkina faso and neighboring nations to confront a qaeda threat in the region that consolidated several factions into one this year
the general said he did not know details of last weeks ambush but that based on his experience he would expect the investigation to examine several areas including the teams communications logistics and medical evacuation plans and whether protocols were being followed for an adviseandassist mission in which the nigeriens were in the lead"

"__label__real moscow reuters russia accused the united states on wednesday of allowing islamic state to operate under its nose in syria saying washington was letting the militant group move about freely in an area abutting a us military base
the allegations made by russias defense ministry center on a us military base at tanf a strategic syrian highway border crossing with iraq in the south of the country
russia says the us base is illegal and that it and the area around it have become a black hole where militants operate unhindered
the united states says the tanf facility is a temporary base used to train partner forces to fight against islamic state pentagon spokesman colonel robert manning on tuesday said washington remained committed to killing off islamic state and denying it safe havens and the ability to carry out strikes
but majorgeneral igor konashenkov a spokesman for the russian defense ministry said moscow wanted to know how around 300 islamic state militants in pickup trucks had passed through the uscontrolled area and tried to block the highway between damascus and deir alzor used to supply syrian forces
he said the us had not yet given an explanation
we suggest the american side also explain about another incidence of their selective blindness towards militants operating under their nose konashenkov said in a statement
he said about 600 militants based in a refugee camp in the us controlled area had driven en masse to a former customs post called tafas on the syrianjordanian border earlier this month and seized food and medical supplies meant for locals
you dont need to be an expert to now forecast an attempt to rupture the peace agreement in the southern deescalation zone said konashenkov
we issue a warning all responsibility for sabotaging the peace process will lay exclusively with the american side"

washington reuters president donald trump was expected to sign an executive order on thursday that would make it easier for americans to buy barebones health insurance plans and circumvent rules put in place by obamacare though such an order could face legal challenges
stymied in congress by the failure of senate republicans to roll back former president barack obamas 2010 healthcare law trumps executive order would represent his administrations latest effort to undermine the law without legislation
the order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy cheaper health plans that would be exempt from some obamacare requirements among the requirements would be the mandate that all health plans cover 10 essential health benefits including maternity and newborn care prescription drugs and mental health and addiction treatment
the order would also change an obamaera limit on the time span people can use shortterm health insurance plans which are cheaper but cover few medical benefits trump was expected to order an extension for the period that long shortterm insurance can be used to about a year versus three months under obamacare
republicans despite having control of the white house and both chambers of congress have for months been unable to make good on their sevenyear promise to repeal obamacare which they view as a government intrusion into americans healthcare
file photo sen rand paul rky speaks at a press conference about the latest republican effort to repeal and replace the affordable care act on capitol hill in washington us september 25 2017 reutersaaron p bernstein
experts questioned whether trump has the legal authority to expand association health plans and whether some plans but not others could be exempt from obamacare rules
the action could open trump to legal challenges from democratic state attorneys general who have said they will sue trump if he tries to destroy obamacare a law that brought health insurance coverage to millions of americans
file photo senator ron johnson rwi speaks with reporters after the failure of the skinny repeal health care bill on capitol hill in washington us july 28 2017 reutersaaron p bernstein
experts said the association health plans could attract young healthy people and leave a sicker more expensive patient pool in the individual insurance markets created under the healthcare law driving up premiums and effectively eroding the laws protection for those with preexisting conditions
conservative groups and lawmakers including republican senator rand paul who said he has worked with trump for months on the expected order and republican senator ron johnson have cheered the expected order paul opposed the senates most recent attempt to overhaul obamacare because he said it left too many of obamcares regulations and spending programs in place
trump has taken a number of steps since assuming power in january to weaken or undermine obamacare he has not committed to making billions of dollars of payments to insurers guaranteed under obamacare prompting many to exit the individual market or hike premiums for 2018
the administration also halved the open enrollment period which begins nov 1 and slashed the obamacare advertising and outreach budget"

while ms silverman is avoiding that kind of argumentative tactic in her own show she saw his success as supporting her views about change he was not a political person at all until it affected his life she said of mr kimmel referring to his son who was born in april with a heart ailment mr kimmel and ms silverman once dated sometimes it takes a personal experience to get woke to things

ms silverman tall and poised has a warm presence listening to questions as intently as she answers them she sometimes shifts between plainspoken even folksy slang and her old kewpie doll voice codeswitching between savvy and silly gimleteyed and wideeyed
she grew up in bedford nh in one of few jewish families in her neighborhood her mother ran a community theater and her father inherited the family clothing business passing along his sense of humor when ms silverman was a toddler he taught her how to say a string of curse words shed sit on his lap short black bangs adorable round face and say this and wed all laugh recalled her older sister susan silverman

ms silverman whose childhood bedroom ceiling had i love steve martin written on it was a comedy prodigy she told jokes onstage for the first time at 15 and dropped out of college after freshman year at new york university to work clubs by 22 she joined the cast of saturday night live she lasted only a year but sketch comedy and sitcoms were never the goal she was the rare standup back then who didnt see it as a means said sam seder who directed ms silverman in her first film whos the caboose standup was the end
when asked about her ambition in her first years of new york comedy she said she wanted to sleep with everyone i was so excited about sex once i had it and i lost my virginity to a comedian so it was like in front of everyone she said i was attracted to funny people she speaks fondly of her formative days in new york clubs but also said she now realizes what a misogynistic culture she dwelled in
i was told youre only a real comedian if your material can be said by a male comedian and it still worked she said with exasperation i bought that looking back its mindblowing i accepted talking about the female experience as hack
ms silverman eventually pushed past that attitude telling jokes about sex and dating whose innocent affect belied what she was really saying mr seder who dated her in the early 1990s recalls traveling to new hampshire with her to perform a benefit given by her mother on stage ms silverman told a story about how in the middle of licking jelly off her boyfriends penis she realized oh my god im turning into my mother
photo
i couldnt believe she did that joke not just in front of her mother but her entire world mr seder said but they laughed
over the next decade ms silverman developed a reputation as a sharp joke writer and performer but she burst on the national scene in 2001 after saying a racial slur for chinese people on late night with conan obrien that drew condemnation and an apology from the talk show she debated guy aoki of the media action network for asianamericans on politically incorrect that whole conan controversy made me famous she said im not proud of it but i have to admit it

in 2005 ms silverman had a major breakthrough with sarah silverman jesus is magic an influential off broadway show turned feature film where she made elegantly crafted jokes in the voice of a naïvely offensive jewish woman building jokes about rape the holocaust aids and race she used what she calls her unreliable narrator character to distance herself from her material
she received many glowing reviews but a critique from ao scott in the new york times made her take a hard look at her act it argued that her kind of ironic transgressive humor flatters herself and her audience playing it safe looking back now i was playing an ignorant character but i also really was ignorant she said when ao scott wrote that it hit me hard i just felt like it opened up my mind like a good hallucinogeni

ms silverman paused made a bewildered face and repeated the word hallucinogenic several times with slightly different pronunciations tilting her head in a pantomime of confusion twice during the interview she flamboyantly searched for the right way to say a word she did it once in her test show turning it into a selfdeprecating verbal pratfall
i love you america marries a longrunning interest in scatological humor and stomping on taboos with a new more politically conscious voice in a video segment where she spends time with a family who never met a jew before she bonds with their young boy with the great unifier a fart joke
unlike many veteran comics ms silverman does not lament that political correctness is ruining comedy saying she no longer uses words like retard on her test show she brought up microaggressions
if youre so scared of changing with the times then youre old she said there are comedians i love to pieces who roll their eyes oh another word i cant say you dont know enough words

the presidential election was clearly a turning point for ms silverman on the night donald j trump won ms silverman was walking her dog when her sister called she was sobbing beside herself like her guts were coming out susan silverman said but in that conversation she said we have to start listening to each other and cant go on like this in our own echo chambers
ms silvermans attitudes about ambition have changed too she said she now puts her career first adding that while she loves her current boyfriend the british actor michael sheen the relationship works because he lives an ocean away ive watched myself over many years give up a lot of things because im in relationships she said describing herself as oddly subservient in romance im older now and i dont want to do that i want to make stuff that matters and put my whole self into it

ms silverman has done more dramatic acting of late see the current battle of the sexes but after a few narrative pilots for television didnt work out she decided she wanted to try something closer to standup a show where she plays herself looks at the camera and talks to people who dont necessarily agree with her but its not easy
she invited the conservative comic dennis miller to be a guest but he turned her down when she noticed that ivanka trump followed her on twitter she sent her a direct message saying she has a chance to make a difference no response she said ive given up on her since and her forays into red state america for her show she traveled to a small texas town where president trump won by 87 percent and spent a day with a family of trump voters in a suburb outside new orleans have led to culture clashes
photo
in louisiana a female trump voter complained that president barack obama gave away handouts while her family talked about being on medicaid ms silverman spends more time listening than factchecking which may not satisfy liberals who delight in seeing john oliver or samantha bee eviscerate conservatives at the same time its hard to see trump voters thinking this segment is for them either
the most obviously commercial aspect of the show may be ms silvermans star power a livewire performer she has a sly teasing sensibility that has always been far too offkilter to be blandly relatable whether she has enough room to roam will likely be crucial to the shows success
reflecting on her interactions with the family in louisiana ms silverman said that she had a good time and found agreement on some issues like samesex marriage when asked if this visit made her more hopeful for change ms silverman weighed her words carefully what makes me hopeful is when youre face to face you can still enjoy and respect each other she said did we change minds no
whats important she said is accepting that you might not always be right years of therapy have helped her find the joy in realizing when she is wrong i am lucky because most people hate it she said ive dated guys who i love to death but they cannot say sorry it would kill them to say sorry to me i love it it makes the person im talking to feel so good a total high
this was apparent in our interview when we disagreed over how to categorize i love you america i saw it as a talk show ms silverman disagreed associating that genre with topicality and a guest promoting projects when i said its interesting that she resists the term she responded sharply that its interesting that i want to pigeonhole the show it was tense but not for long
she paused than flashed a big smile ok i am a host she said i dont care whatever you want to call it
on the show her guests are people who have undergone a change and its clear that ms silverman puts a premium on transformation megan phelpsroper who left the westboro baptist church an ultraconservative group will be a future guest

former north korean soldier now defector joo il kim publishes a newspaper free nk which he hopes will awaken his fellow citizens by giving them a glimpse of the outside world
because they are brainwashed even if we deliver the truth they cant see it kim said i think the key is to give information that the north korean citizens will not be afraid to have something like pop culture which they are curious about or some fun news that occurs in the world society would be one way to do it
the 43year old publishes his paper from new malden a 30minute train ride from central london which is home to an estimated 10000 ethnic koreans
among them are about 700 north koreans the largest such community in europe
the south korean embassy was once based in new malden and its where tech company samsung first established its european headquarters
both have since left but the korean diaspora still uses it as a base to ease the transition to the west and remain close to members of their community
defectors work in kitchens
dozens of korean restaurants line new maldens streets where some north korean defectors work in the kitchens preparing classic dishes from home kimchi and barbecue meat
the latest volley of threats between united states and north korea has some worried in this community but they cannot check on their families still inside the country communication with the outside world is extremely difficult in north korea and calls home carry great risk
one defector activist jihyun park told cnn that she once tried to contact her brotherinlaw in north korea
a couple of years ago she paid a smuggler in china 1000 pounds 1300 to get a prepaid cellphone to his home in north korea
the phone call cost her brotherinlaw much more he was sent to a labor camp for six months park later heard

i thought instead of being captured and dying in the prison as a political criminal dying while i swim would be the same thing she said
in 2004 kim 63 and her nephew jumped into the yalu river and swam eight hours until the pair reached china
i left without knowing about the outside world i lived in north korea without knowing that the world out here has freedom and happiness but once i got out it seems like the people there are all living a lie kim said

sending news home
joo il kim told cnn he too was once unequivocally loyal to the north korean regime
when i was in north korea i was a model student kim said from the time i was in school i trusted the text books 100 and trusted the north korean governments revolution simply put i grew up trusting the north korean regime completely
he joined the army and was a loyal soldier of the ruling dynasty that began with founder kim il sung but that changed after he saw his nephew starve to death before his eyes he defected brazenly crossing the border into china in 2007 while still wearing his military uniform
cnn was unable to independently verify the details of kims or parks story
like many in new malden kim does not know if his family in north korea is dead or alive he simply tries not to let these thoughts enter his mind
i believe there must have been a punishment perhaps punishment that i cannot even imagine kim said
north korean defectors say they have seen families of other defectors punished in order to deter their countrymen from leaving pyongyang also operates under a system in which families can be collectively punished for the crimes of an individual
i try not think about it now because if there is emotion involving your family you cannot perform this job i would be an emotional hostage of the north korean regime i do not seek the ways to find my family until the day i go back to north korea he added
joo il kim shows cnn a copy of free nk
the only way he and the hundreds living just outside london can return is if the north korean regime changes and thats exactly what kim is trying to do with his newspaper
we are putting helium in the balloon and attaching the newspaper on the side and because they shoot at it we only do it at night time kim said as he showed a video of him sending copies of free nk by hot air balloon across the south korean border
the father of two is constantly trying to find creative ways to send news home he believes the only solution to the crisis is to educate north korean citizens
if i am the only one enjoying the wealth and comfort here just by myself i will feel guilty towards the people left behind in north korea he said
as long as i am here in a free land i will never starve to death even if i dont do anything but the north koreans are suffering every day hungry and mistreated every day"

lewis hamilton says he is taking nothing for granted in the title race despite opening a huge lead with victory in the japanese grand prix
the mercedes driver leads sebastian vettel by 59 points after his ferrari rival retired early in suzuka
i just have to keep my head down and keep doing what ive been doing hamilton said there are still 100 points available
weve still got to win the next four races
hamilton has taken four wins and a second place in the five races since formula 1 returned from its summer break at the belgian grand prix at the end of august
by contrast vettels bid has imploded with a startline crash in singapore followed by engine issues affecting his races in malaysia and japan
hamilton will clinch the title if he wins the next race the us grand prix in austin texas and vettel is lower than fourth
hamilton said is it a purple patch a golden patch maybe its definitely been a great second half of the season an incredible performance from the team
lewis hamilton celebrated with the mobot as olympian sir mo farah looked on
hamilton said his advantage was kind of unbelievable really adding i could only have dreamed of having this kind of gap ferrari have put on such a great challenge all season long my team have done a great job they are so meticulous and that is why we have the reliability we are having
vettel suffered a problem with a spark plug which cost him power and the team retired his car after four laps
the problem comes a week after he started from the back of the grid in malaysia after a failure in a manifold in the engine in qualifying an issue which also caused teammate kimi raikkonens retirement before the race started the next day
vettel admitted that winning the championship would now be difficult
of course he said i dont have to be a mathematician what we have to do now and i said also to the guys lets get back get some rest it has been tough weeks with a lot of changes
the mechanics are tired the team is tired it is good to get some rest and then we know we have the package to do well in the last four races thats what we focus to do and the rest well see
mercedes f1 boss toto wolff said this is a sport where you take no prisoners and reliability is part of making it to the end and we have been there in the last few years
we just need to collect the points but i can relate to how it feels for ferrari and it is certainly not very nice
it is not over until its over we have seen with sebastians misfortune how quickly you can lose points it is all about finishing the races
there are 100 points left we just need to look one race weekend after the other and score austin can be a solid step towards the championship but we wont be counting our chickens until its done"

delay delay delay the american zionist council and aipac which was azcs unincorporated lobbying committee were ordered by the kennedy administration to register in 1962 this followed a massive propaganda campaign targeting congress and the american public funded with foreign money aimed at winning unconditional foreign aid and diplomatic support for israel azc strung along the department of justice until 1965 long enough to orchestrate a paper restructuring of its operations that led to the incorporation of aipac as a separate entity politically pressure doj and political elites into a special exemption whether trying to avoid an espionage prosecution like the antidefamation league or ignoring seven separate orders to register under fara like the zionist organization of america sometimes it takes a visit with the attorney general himself or in the case of janet reno herself zoa was ordered to register in 1938 as a subsidiary and subject to the direction of the world zionist organization like aipac it strung along the enforcement process in its case until 1960 the registration effort was serious an internal doj memo ten years into the lengthy effort noted if zoa is to be exempted from registration doj might as well forget its entire campaign however justice department employees began detecting political pushback pdf the pressure was on somewhere in the government it would be unwise to do anything furtherunder the circumstances do not desire for the moment to write to the zionist organization of america multiple israel affinity organizations ordered to register simultaneously refused to comply with fara orders citing a certain high official in the department of justice had assured them that pdf the department would not require any zionist group to register and need not fear prosecution clarify that russia is not the soviet union early in the drive to register azcaipac as foreign agents their lead lawyer made an appeal for prosecutorial discretion maurice boukstein argued that the 1938 foreign agents registration act had been crafted to target and expose nazi and soviet propaganda efforts in the united states while the language of course comprehends everybody lobbying for israel should not be treated the same he argued rt like advocates coordinating with and on behalf of israel could similarly argue that the soviet union is dead and gone and that russia now only wants to be friends reconstitute the jewish agencys american section which had funneled millions of foreign funds into azcaipac faced a fara order that seemed unbeatable the jewish agencys direct ties to the israeli government and knesset were exposed in 1969 when the jewish agency was ordered by the doj to file its secret 1953 covenant agreement after a 1970 justice department review the american section of the jewish agency filed its final fara disclosure in 1971 it then reemerged three months later claiming to be the american section of the world zionist organization an entity with no israeli government covenant the department of justice noting that the physical address leadership staff and functions of the new entity had not changed labeled the reconstitution sketchy but did nothing meanwhile overseas the jewish agency continued to funnel support to its us agents dennis ross served as chairman of the jewish agencys jewish people planning institute in jerusalem until entering the obama administration to headup the fatally flawed peace process in 2009 volunteer to spy for the cia and fbi in the 1940s and 1950s the jewish telegraphic agency came under heavy scrutiny to file as a foreign agent by the fbi and department of justice an internal 1950s doj report found that the israeli government which is seriously short of dollar credits is supposed to be underwriting the operations of jta to the extent of 5000 per month the jta was never ordered to register and it is unclear whether it was jtas intense efforts to ingratiate itself with the fbi that finally provided the leniency it needed in 1942 the head of jta proposed the fbi pay 540 per month to leverage jtas network of correspondents in latin america as an intelligence gathering service to bolster the appeal of the offer the proposal noted that the oss predecessor of the cia was already paying 300 per month for similar services in 1950 jtas milton friedman volunteered to spy on the soviet union using his jta press credential as nonofficial cover jta also offered to spy on ukrainians residing in the united states
ultimately rt may find it does not have the required number of sympathizers inside and outside the us government the requisite moral character or enough money to pull off such fara avoidance shenanigans however the rt fara order may reignite broader american interest in the selectivity with which fara is enforced the key question has long been if israels foreign agents working tirelessly to influence the government and public opinion arent registering why should anyone

cnn on monday hayley geftmangold a top cbs executive posted on facebook that she didnt have sympathy for the victims gunned down at the country music festival in las vegas because country music fans are often republican gun toters
she was immediately fired
as a democrat who favors strict gun control laws i was outraged by geftmangolds statement about the deadliest shooting in american history its unconscionable to not feel for the victims of such a heinous crime
thats why cbs was right to fire her geftmangold is one of a long line of individuals who have been axed for saying outrageous things on social media remember the interactivecorp pr executive who tweeted that she wouldnt get aids in africa because she was white or the florida prosecutor who posted on facebook after last years shooting at the pulse nightclub that all of orlandos nightclubs should be shuttered because theyre cesspools of debauchery
these cases are warnings for us all to think before we tweet every day the words and images we all choose to share can do more than simply embarrass us they can affect our entire future sue scheff and melissa schorr caution in their new book shame nation the global epidemic of online hate 
these instances are also rare cases in which its acceptable for companies to fire staffers for their social media posts when employees write posts as private citizens which may be damaging to their employers reputation or which call into question the employees abilities to perform their jobs they should be fired
though much of this may be intuitive companies should spell out for staffers what sorts of posts racist sexist or otherwise are unacceptable and subject to disciplinary action nicholas fortuna founder and managing partner of the law firm allyn fortuna llp says it is generally legal to fire staffers for such reasons unless there is a written contract limiting the circumstances in which an employee can be fired an employer may fire someone without cause for any or no reason as long as its not an impermissible reason such as discussing terms and conditions of employment discrimination based on race sex national origin in some states sexual orientation etc he says
just watched florida prosecutor suspended after online orlando rant replay more videos must watch florida prosecutor suspended after online orlando rant 0040
but prohibiting these kinds of outrageous posts are the only time employers should get involved in what their staffers share on their personal social media accounts
currently many companies have policies that dont allow any staffers except public relations executives to talk about their organizations on social media thats a bad idea employees clearly cant be allowed to post trade secrets but broader bans on discussing work are generally a mistake and for three reasons
first when a company is under attack employees are often quick to come to the defense of their employers on social media a 2014 study by weber shandwick one of the worlds largest pr firms found that almost 60 of employees have defended their employers either to their friends and family or more publicly but they can only do so if theyre empowered to post
take this linkedin post for example written by an amazon employee who defended the company of his own volition in response to a negative article in the new york times which claimed that amazon is a hostile place to work
follow cnn opinion join us on twitter and facebook
second its bad for a companys reputation to be seen as limiting their staffers rights to free speech one way to prevent negative discussions of a company on public platforms is to provide internal forums where employees can debate work issues something that google has done for years it doesnt always work as we saw when a memo by a google engineer questioning womens ability to handle tech jobs went public in august that staffer was fired too but its a good way to move a lot of critical and possibly controversial discussions to private platforms
third companies risk breaking the law by firing employees for certain social media posts particularly those about workplace conditions under the national labor relations act employers cant restrict or prevent employees from speaking out about their terms and conditions of employment says fortuna that is true even if the employees speak out in an offensive manner
so geftmangolds posting offers lessons for us all think carefully before you fire off a tweet and also before you fire a staffer for doing so"

editors note this is the minority report world we have entered please also see the article by nicholas west which covers the use of billboards to predict peoples political views this is already being used in many areas around the world its called neuropolitics naturally this is terrific for advertisers in our digitally connected world of smart devices that monitor us at all times
imagine driving down a highway and seeing a personalized billboard ad directed at you now imagine advertisers using billboards to send messages to your smartphone
thats the future of advertised spying in america yes i made that term up
an article in mcclatchy warns that a new generation of smart digital billboards will detect the make model and year of oncoming vehicles and project ads tailored to the motorist
the article ominously warns that smart billboards can guess a motorists home address age race and income level based on the vehicle they are driving and also claims that advertisers will be able to send messages to a persons smartphone as they pass by a smart billboard
companies like synaps want to create a network of spying billboards
synaps boasts about designing intelligent sensors that recognize car models and help a billboard choose the best message for their drivers
synaps describes how advertisers can personalize their advertising
it really is up to you to choose who will see your advertising and it does not matter where the billboard is pick your segment based on a specific car model and age car price or size or even how conservative or modern it is source
mits connection to spying billboards
synaps appears to have gotten its start in russia as a recent article in mit technology review points out
cofounders alex pustov and alesky utkin expect to be operating 2050 smart billboards in russia this year they also claim to encrypt all the license plate data they collect
would you trust a foreign company with our license plate data
what is mits connection to synaps
according to synaps their american business is located at mits martin trust in cambridge massachusetts
what does martin trust do
they claim to supply students with support and connections to become effective entrepreneurs
martin trust also claims they nurture and assist new companies and make sure they have longterm success
the mcclatchy article warned that smart billboards can spy on cellphones
smart billboards can also target motorists on the highway or pedestrians passing bus shelters by picking up cellular or mobile signatures wifi signals or even beaconing given off by certain apps source
unfortunately universities helping companies or government agencies to spy on the public has become the norm click here to read how 200 universities are working with dhs
would you trust a foreign company with our license plate and cellphone data will american law enforcement have access to that data
synaps is not the only company using smart billboards to target and track our travel patterns since 2015 automakers lexus gm and chevrolet seen below have been using smart billboards to spy on motorists
earlier this year general motors received requests from numerous automotive companies and car dealerships to purchase their smart billboards fyi gm has also been using facial recognition billboards to spy on people
last year yahoo patented a smart billboard that uses cameras and microphones to spy on everyone
the search giant has received a patent for a smart billboard that uses cameras microphones and a range of sensors to capture information of passersby for ad targeting purposes the sensors cameras and microphones would work together to gather information about passersby for ad targeting purposes free stormproof waterproof survival match kit ad source
theres no getting around it smart billboards are really corporate advertised spying devices
smart billboards collect cellphone data
last year new york senator chuck schumer warned everyone that smart billboards are spying on our cell phones
clear channel uses radar analytics to spy on americans travel and conversations click here to watch the video
the official party line is to say the data they collect is anonymized but as i have stated numerous times thats not the case click here here here to find out more
we should assume that law enforcement will have access to smart billboard data just like they have with cctv cameras
smart billboards coupled with cctv cameras will create a huge surveillance network that would rival the united kingdom for the most spied on nation in the world

"__label__real three us soldiers have been killed and two others wounded in an ambush in niger near the border with mali the us africa command has said
another soldier from a partner nation had also died in the attack it said without specifying their nationality
the us soldiers had been providing advice and assistance in nigers counterterror operations and come under hostile fire it said
islamist militants including alqaeda fighters operate in the region
they are most active in neighbouring mali where french troops intervened in 2013 to prevent them from advancing on the capital
the boko haram group based in nigeria to the south has also staged several attacks in niger
us president donald trump has been briefed by his chiefofstaff john kelly about the attack white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said

the two injured us soldiers had been evacuated to the landstuhul regional medical centre in germany and were in a stable condition it added
according to the new york times those killed were special forces soldiers and were the first americans to die as a result of hostile fire since the us africa command deployed in niger
earlier an official from nigers tillaberi region told reuters that five nigerien soldiers were among the dead
it is not clear who fired on the soldiers
militants belonging to alqaeda in the islamic maghreb aqim an affiliate of alqaeda are active in the region and are known to have conducted crossborder raids
scale of jihadist threat
by tommy oladipo bbc africa security correspondent
this attack will draw attention to the presence of us troops not just in niger but in other countries too in a letter to congress in june president trump confirmed there were 645 military personnel deployed to niger to support counterterrorism missions there
the us has long maintained that its troops play a train advise and assist role with its partners whether in the sahel or the horn of africa its acknowledgement that the troops in southwest niger were carrying out a joint patrol with local forces is being explained as the us providing security assistance but it is not clear how broadly this assistance is defined
the attack also highlights the scale of the jihadist threat in niger a vast nation with a varied jihadist presence boko haram in nigeria militants linked to both alqaeda and socalled islamic state in mali and uncertainty from unstable libya in the north
for as long as the regional jihadist threat remains the us and other western powers will continue to strengthen their presence on the ground their target the jihadists will also be motivated to take them on"

walmart puts its eggs in a timesaving basket grocery pickup seeking an edge against amazon the retail giant is pushing a service that delivers your order to your car customers never have to step inside the store
image a worker at the walmart in turnersville nj with items he selected for customers credit harrison hill for the new york times
a personal shopper is something you might expect at bergdorf goodman or a boutique on madison avenue
not at the walmart on route 42 in turnersville nj
but thats where you will find joann joseph and a team of walmart workers each day filling up shopping carts with boxes of honeycomb cereal cheezits and salted peanuts
the customers select their groceries online and then the shoppers pick the items off the store shelves and deliver them to people when they arrive in the parking lot customers never have to step inside the store
its about saving people time ms joseph said as she helped load groceries into the back of a minivan one morning
walmart which is one of the largest food retailers in the united states sees grocery pickup as a way to marry its ecommerce business with its gigantic network of stores a goal that has eluded many other retailers the company started ramping up the service two years ago and it is now available in about 1000 of walmarts 4699 stores across the country
the initiative is the latest salvo in walmarts retail battle with amazon and the centerpiece of its strategy to gain the upper hand in the pursuit of consumers looking to streamline their food shopping

many retailers are focused on new ways to deliver groceries to peoples homes particularly in big cities walmart is betting big on the millions of americans in suburban and rural areas who drive everywhere the company is trying to make ordering groceries online and then picking them up in your car as seamless as a fastfood drivethrough
groceries have become one of the most fiercely contested areas of retail amazon upped the ante in june with its 134 billion purchase of whole foods giving it a major foothold in the industry lidl the german supermarket chain is also making a big push to open stores in the united states
grocery delivery companies like fresh direct have spawned a contest among traditional grocers and startups to offer faster home delivery
amid this heated competition walmart has been experimenting with different ways to get an edge in a few cities it works with uber to deliver groceries to homes
and last month walmart said it would begin testing a homedelivery service in which a worker loads the food into the refrigerator even when no one is home the customer can watch the process remotely from a home security camera and track when the delivery worker enters and leaves the house
while these initiatives are limited to only a few states the companys grocery pickup is widespread walmart is betting that a big part of the country from scranton to sacramento one walmart executive said is more of a drivethrough than delivery culture
there is a risk that walmarts new grocery strategy could undercut its sales of other products selling groceries has lower profits but it brings customers into the store regularly allowing walmart to push biggerticket items
that is the philosophy of the supercenter you put all these other categories under one roof said gene german a professor emeritus of food marketing at cornell university so if the customers dont go into the stores that could be a negative
but walmart believes that the high touch approach of online grocery ordering is improving peoples opinion of the shopping experience at its stores making them more likely to purchase general merchandise in addition to food
we get feedback and how much they appreciate the time that we take in fulfilling a grocery order said mike turner a vice president of walmarts ecommerce operations said in an interview
walmart does not disclose its online grocery sales but when the company reported its secondquarter results in august it said online sales including grocery had increased 60 percent from a year earlier
the company also indicated that overall food sales growth had been the best in five years
image shiahna mcgirt shopping at the walmart in turnersville with her family the company said in august that its overall food sales growth had been the best in five years credit harrison hill for the new york times
for decades walmart was seen as the worlds foremost innovator in retail but even as the company has become the worlds largest retailer it has been overshadowed in many ways by amazons rapid growth and many advancements
amazons longterm strategy for whole foods however is not clear amazon must figure out how to sync its core online business and warehouse network with more than 460 whole foods stores many of which are in highpriced urban areas and can be costly to operate
walmart faces a different set of challenges and opportunities with its online grocery pickup which were on display at the supercenter in turnersville outside philadelphia
the strategys promise is that walmart can uses its thousands of stores as minifulfillment centers while also avoiding the costs of home delivery but the store does not always function like a warehouse
one morning ms joseph walked through the aisles pushing a cart and scrolling through a handheld device that listed the order a customer had placed online
like gps services for cars her device mapped out the most efficient route she grabbed a box of honeycomb in one aisle then a box of lipton berry tea in another
but when ms joseph reached the peanut aisle she hit a snag the customer had ordered a fivepack of individualsize servings of salted peanuts
there were no more individualsize packs she checked the candy and snack displays at the cash registers but there were none there either
so ms joseph improvised borrowing a colleagues iphone she calculated the amount of peanuts in the pack of individual servings and then she selected a jug of peanuts with comparable volume
your instinct needs to kick in ms joseph said and you go with it
each substitution is supposed to be clearly marked with a sticker so the customer is not surprised
customers order their groceries online and then can pick them up at the store a few hours later during a certain time window

image credit harrison hill for the new york times
walmart is also showering grocery pickup customers with perks easter eggs hidden in grocery bags a beauty box for moms at mothers day dog biscuits and discounts for recruiting new customers
its unclear how the company will be able maintain this kind of dedicated service if a store is inundated with pickup orders which in many stores are free of charge and require an order of 30 or more
walmart said it had hired thousands of workers to staff the new service across its many stores
this is something walmart could get into easily and quickly mr german said and it would send a message to shareholders we are not going to be passive we are going to be proactive
customers who order online choose a onehour window in which they can pick up their groceries when they arrive at the walmart parking lot they pull into designated grocery pickup spots which at some stores resemble a gas station with a canopy overhead minutes later a personal shopper emerges from the store with bags of groceries
when laura rothwein of clayton nj pulled up in her minivan to the side of the turnersville store the personal shoppers greeted her 6yearold son with a treat from the bakery and a bottle of red gatorade
a short time later sherri arrison a retiree arrived in her nissan murano one personal shopper loaded groceries into the back while another held out a bright orange umbrella to shelter the food from the rain
this is pretty much the only way i shop now ms arrison said i dont have to go into the store and keep walking around

rome reuters the italian government called on tuesday for confidence votes in the lower house of parliament to try to force through an electoral law that is likely to penalize the antiestablishment 5star movement
the new voting law which would be used in a national election due by next may is backed by the ruling democratic party pd former prime minister silvio berlusconis forza italia go italy and the antimigrant northern league
unlike the current rules the new system known as the rosatellum would allow the formation of broad coalitions before the ballot a factor likely to hurt the maverick 5star which refuses to join alliances
the party which tops many opinion polls says the rosatellum could cost it up to 50 seats in parliament it has called for protests on wednesday when the lower house is due to hold two confidence motions a third vote is set for thursday
this is a mortal blow to democracy a violation of democratic laws said luigi di maio the 5stars candidate for prime minister the aim is to destroy us
italys political landscape is highly fragmented and successive governments have failed to reduce the nations huge debt mountain and struggled to revive the economy investors fear political instability here could undermine the euro
president sergio mattarella the only figure with the power to dissolve parliament has demanded new voting rules be drawn up because at present there is too much divergence between the systems for electing members of the two houses of parliament
previous efforts at reform have all ended in failure thanks to a matrix of conflicting interests the latest version offers a mix of firstpastthepost and proportional representation and gives party leaders a huge say over nominating candidates
although the rosatellum will likely hurt 5star analysts say it looks unlikely to throw up a clear parliamentary majority with opinion polls showing the centerleft centerright and 5star splitting the vote three ways
a government is obliged to resign if it loses a confidence vote so only deploys the motion if it thinks key legislation might get held up or radically altered without its intervention
in this case the government motions will sweep away dozens of secret votes on various aspects of the law which would have allowed disaffected parliamentarians from the traditional parties to sink the bill as happened in june during a prior attempt to introduce new electoral rules
the ruling pd dismissed accusations that it was subverting democracy saying there would still be one final secret vote on the whole package
in this secret vote we will see if the law is good or bad said ettore rosato the parliamentary party leader of the pd who has put his name to the reform
this is the last chance we have to put in place an electoral law and we want to avoid just weeks ahead of the ballot any traps he told reporters
prime minister paolo gentiloni hopes to get the bill through the lower house of parliament by the end of the week after which it will go to the upper house senate where the government has no clearly defined majority"

it catalonia were to split from spain the region would immediately cease to be part of the european union the eu has made clear
while eus treaties dont specify what happens if part of a member state declares independence eu sources say whats called the prodi doctrine would apply
named after the former president of the european commission romano prodi the position is that a region seceding from a member country is automatically no longer part of the eu
it means that on the day any catalan independence took effect catalonia would quit the eu it would lose the right to free movement around europe for any holders of catalan passports and for goods and services too
even using the euro as a catalan currency could prove problematic and catalonia could only rejoin the eu by starting a new membership application as a new country
but any existing member state could veto this so spain or any other country could prevent an independent catalonias eu membership
catalonias parliament had been due to meet on monday with the expectation that it would endorse the declaration of independence based on the majority yes vote on 1 october

however the session was blocked by the spanish constitutional court which had likewise sought to stop the referendum itself
speculation is intense as to what mr puigdemont may say when he addresses the parliament in barcelona on tuesday evening
he could ask the parliament to declare independence on the basis of the referendum law it passed last month which in turn could lead the spanish government of prime minister mariano rajoy to suspend devolution acting under article 155 of the constitution
the bbc understands that whatever mr puigdemont says his statement will trigger the 48hour period within which mps need to declare independence according to the catalan law
it is also understood the catalan leadership has already decided on the way forward
an mp from mr puigdemonts party told the bbc on sunday that the current plan was to stop short of declaring independence unilaterally and make a symbolic statement instead

final results from the referendum suggest 43 of catalan voters turned out and 90 of them backed independence but no voters largely boycotted the ballot
at least 350000 people joined a unionist rally in barcelona on sunday after recent massive rallies by separatists and democracy activists in the city
the crisis has been largely peaceful although some 900 civilians and 33 police officers were hurt on referendum day when police sought to stop the vote at some polling stations by force

"__label__real washington reuters nfl team owners will consider requiring football players to stand for the us national anthem after president donald trump on tuesday suggested using tax laws to penalize the league for players who kneel in protest of racial injustice
trump a republican escalated his feud with the national football league in a twitter post asking if the league should get tax breaks while some athletes kneel in protest when the starspangled banner is played at the start of each game
why is the nfl getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our anthem flag and country change tax law trump wrote on twitter
the worlds topgrossing sports league gave up its taxfree status two years ago its owners are preparing to address the anthem issue at their fall meeting in new york oct 1718 nfl chief spokesman joe lockhart told reporters on a conference call on tuesday
everyone at this point is frustrated by the situation lockhart said the commissioner and the owners do want the players to stand we think it is an important part of the game
the protests in a league where africanamericans make up the majority of players have continued through the season with some players taking a knee when the anthem is played and others standing arminarm in solidarity
current policy calls for players to stand for the anthem and face the flag but no player has been disciplined for a protest lockhart said
related coverage factbox can trump kill nfl stadium tax breaks five facts to consider
we need to move past this controversy and we want to do that together with our players nfl commissioner roger goodell wrote in a memo to team owners
the white house supported the idea of asking players to stand said spokeswoman sarah sanders
we are glad to see the nfl taking positive steps in that direction she said at a news briefing

asked to explain trumps comment on the nfl and taxes sanders said the federal tax law doesnt apply here but certainly we know that they receive tax subsidies on a variety of different levels
the nfl players association when asked for a reaction to possible changes to anthem rules said in an email we do not have a response at this time
trump last month called on nfl team owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem to protest police violence against black americans
critics contend trump is fanning the controversy to distract from issues including devastation in puerto rico after hurricane maria tensions with north korea and difficulties in pushing healthcare and tax overhauls through the us congress

cowboys owner jerry jones speaking on krldfm in dallas on tuesday reiterated his stance that if any of his players chose to demonstrate during the anthem they would not play
if you do not honor and stand for the flag in the way that a lot of our fans feel that you should if thats not the case then you wont play said jones
thats nothing new as far as that being my wish or the way i want the cowboys as far as whether or not i will basically institute or do what i said i would just say i would ask anybody to look at my record relative to what i say im going to do
vice president mike pence walked out of a nfl game on sunday after some players knelt an action some critics called a publicity stunt
trump won the presidency with less support from black voters than any other president in at least four decades
trump has squared off against the nfl before having owned a team in the upstart united states football league in the 1980s that league folded in 1985 after an antitrust lawsuit against the nfl failed
trump has refused to disclose his own tax history departing from a practice of us presidents going back more than 40 years trump has said nobody cares about his tax returns but critics say they could show conflicts of interest"

its much better to say we are linked up with these two terrific organizations that understand how to build an arena he said the fact that the mets have endorsed us financially and say that belmont park is the best option that sends a very strong message as well that were making the right decision here

the islanders returned to the renovated nassau coliseum for a soldout preseason game on sept 17 but nhl commissioner gary bettman has been adamant that the coliseum which has a capacity of less than 14000 for hockey is not a practical home for the team
ledecky said barclays center was a good home for now and agreed with bettman regarding the cozy coliseum
barclays is a wonderful place but unfortunately at the time it was built they decided not to configure it for hockey he said and nassau coliseum is a lovely spot but the commissioner of the nhl is on public record saying it is not viable for an nhl team so that wouldnt be a home either we have to have a focus on a place that will be our home thats belmont park
the islanders will most likely also take into consideration how their pursuit of a new arena deal might affect their ability to resign their captain john tavares whose sixyear 33 million contract expires after this season
islanders general manager garth snow said he would not speculate on how the negotiations might evolve during the season tavares 27 could become a free agent july 1 snow said discussions would remain private between himself tavares and the players agent pat brisson
ledecky said he did not know the timetable for the states decision on the site new york city fc of major league soccer is among the other groups to submit a proposal
we obviously would hope it would be sooner rather than later and we would hope that our proposal is the best proposal ledecky said we dont know if theyve received three or 10 or five we certainly put a lot of time and effort into a firstclass presentation we were thoughtful we want belmont to be our permanent home"

"__label__real media playback is unsupported on your device media caption neck deep protects fans from heavyhanded rock city security
rock band neck deep scrapped their show at nottinghams rock city on monday after what appears to be a physical altercation with security guards
giggoer rob jackson told the bbc he saw one guard almost bodyrolling people to the floor after fans started crowdsurfing two songs into the set
after the band intervened singer ben barlow called the gig off and said security had messed it up
rock city said the staffs response did not appear disproportionate
nottinghamshire police said officers spoke to the victims but no arrests had been made
the investigation is ongoing with a man due to be interviewed in due course added a police spokesman
more in this story and others from the east midlands
mr jackson who attended the show with his teenage daughter and her friends described the scene as a ruckus and said some band members jumped off stage to stop fans getting hurt by what he called heavyhanded security
the band jumped in to intervene to stop fans getting hurt then it turned back on them
georgia stokes a student at nottingham trent university who was near the stage said the staff were being really heavyhanded when people were crowdsurfing and the band were asking them to stop because they were trying to protect their fans
the lead singer just kept stopping singing and saying ok stop this isnt cool
physical confrontation
mr jackson from lincoln added that fans were disappointed but fairly understanding when the gig was cancelled
they continued to chant the song a part of me long after the band explained they would not be returning to the stage
barlow later came out to apologise to fans as the venue cleared
thats never ever ever happened before he said with his apology captured in a video posted on twitter
we never want to call a show off im so sorry that you guys have paid and thats what happened im really sorry thats all i can say im sorry from the bottom of my heart i want to carry on playing the show i want to be up there now
image copyright hopeless records image caption the rest of the bands uk tour is unaffected
in a statement rock city said it appears that the band took exception to the way the rock city security were handling fans who were crowdsurfing into the pit and attempting to get on stage
this unfortunately escalated into a physical confrontation between the band and the security staff
having reviewed the cctv footage and spoken to witnesses it doesnt appear that the security staff were disproportionate in their response
we know how disappointing this has been for the fans who didnt get to see the band play
it added that it was fully investigating the incident and takes safety very seriously
neck deep told the bbc that the events that transpired last night were regretful and deeply unfortunate
things rapidly escalated to a point that they should never have gotten to we believe that violence is never a solution and that everything that went down could and should have been handled better by all parties they said in a statement
we are so very sorry to anyone who was in any way hurt upset or inconvenienced last night
the band added that they were hoping to reschedule the show"

sabathia started game 2 allowing two earned runs over five and a third innings and leaving with the yankees holding an 83 lead girardis decision to remove sabathia who had thrown just 77 pitches turned out to be his secondmost questionable move that evening behind his failure to challenge a hitbypitch call on lonnie chisenhall that set up francisco lindors gamechanging grand slam

we liked the way he pitched girardi said referring to sabathias game 2 outing
lindor and jose ramirez both switchhitters with speed could test sabathias balky right knee by bunting but sabathias october experience outweighed every other consideration girardi said he has appeared in 20 postseason games over all compiling a 95 record with a 447 era but in the 15 of those games that he has pitched for the yankees he has a 72 record with a 349 era and he was named the most valuable player of the 2009 american league championship series against the los angeles angels
all those things went into it girardi said
theres not going to be a moment thats too big for him headley said i know hes going to go out there and whether he pitches great or doesnt pitch his best its not going to be because of the moment hes going to be c c and i expect him to do a phenomenal job
sabathias contract an extension of the sevenyear 161 million deal he signed before the 2009 season will expire along with the yankees postseason run he has made it clear that he intends to continue pitching next season and he might even do it with the yankees who could be inclined to bring him back on a short contract at a greatly reduced salary
advertisement continue reading the main story
it is questionable whether sabathia would be amenable to returning to the yankees on a oneyear deal for about 5 million which is onefifth of his current salary
but his resurgence this year and girardis decision to start him on wednesday sent a powerful message about the life remaining in his left arm
sabathias season was all the more remarkable considering that to pitch effectively he needed a brace for his degenerative right knee which demanded constant maintenance including regular painkilling injections and which led to two stints on the disabled list
and when he left the mound in the sixth inning of his final start of the regular season after holding the toronto blue jays to four hits and no runs the fans at yankee stadium thinking they might have witnessed sabathias final game with the team gave him a standing ovation
that could have been his last game as a yankee but it wasnt gardner said im glad we were able to bring it back to a game 5 and hand the ball over to him hes a biggame pitcher and right now theres no bigger game than this but hes pitched in a lot of big situations a whole lot bigger than this is going to be and hopefully he gets to pitch in a couple more"

he had earlier received a warning for smashing two balls out of court in frustration at a line call
the australian has also not been allowed to collect his 21085 15967 prize money

after his opponent served an ace on his first set point kyrgios walked over to shake hands
umpire fergus murphy asked the australian if he needed medical help before the player walked off court to boos from spectators
at the same tournament last year he was fined for his behaviour and banned
he later posted an apology to fans on social media saying he had been struggling before the match with a stomach bug

mexico city reuters two foreign oil companies on wednesday won the rights to partner with mexicos oil company pemex on two onshore blocks a first since landmark energy reform while a third offshore area received no bids
the auction was run by the national hydrocarbons commission the industry regulator and marks only the second time partnership rights for pemex projects have been made available
egypts cheiron holdings limited and germanys dea deutsche erdoel won the rights to partner with petróleos mexicanos commonly known as pemex on its cardenasmora and ogarrio blocks respectively which officials touted as a way to quickly boost production via new investment
this underscores the beauty of the energy reform said pemex chief executive jose antonio gonzalez anaya shortly after the auction
before we would have to invest everything and now we only have to pay half and we receive a payment to be able to meet those costs he said
mexicos 2013 constitutional reform ended pemexs decadeslong production monopoly it also allowed the company to enter into joint ventures with equity partners for the first time in a bid to help reverse more than a dozen years of declining output
the onshore cardenasmora area a 65squaremile 168 sq km block in southern tabasco state is believed to contain some 93 million barrels of mostly light crude pemex will receive a 125 million payment from cheiron reflecting the companys past investments in the area pemex said in a statement
cheiron also agreed to pay pemex another 41 million on top of the 13 percent additional royalty it bid for the partnerships rights pemex said
the cardenasmora project is seen requiring a total of 11 billion to successfully develop over the life of the contract while the ogarrio project is seen requiring some 490 million according to pemex estimates
were extremely happy and were looking forward to this opportunity said shady kabel cheirons country manager for mexico
in the case of the ogarrio area a 60square mile 156 sq km field also in tabasco estimated to contain 54 million barrels in mostly light crude pemex will receive 190 million from dea deutsche pemex said in a statement
the german company also offered to pay a recordsetting 2139 million for the partnership rights on top of the 13 percent additional royalty a sum that will be divided between pemex and the governments petroleum fund said martin alvarez an official at the national hydrocarbons commission
a third joint venture for the shallow water ayinbatsil block received no bids which gonzalez anaya attributed to the complexity of the project
he also said pemex would review the 250 million that pemex calculated as its past investment in the area a figure a potential partner would have had to reimburse and might have curtailed interest in the project
both cheiron and dea deutsche will operate the projects under license contracts with a 50 percent stake while pemex will retain the remaining half
pemexs chief executive said he expected ogarrios oil output to reach as much as 14000 barrels per day bpd from about 10000 bpd currently over the next year while cardenasmoras production should increase to 14000 bpd by 2020 from about 10000 bpd
late last year pemexs first joint venture partnership was won by australias bhp billiton which took a 60 percent operating interest in the deepwater trion project a development seen requiring some 11 billion over the life of the contract

"__label__fake by brandon turbeville
on september 24 the russian ministry of defense may have corroborated what many researchers and journalists familiar with the syrian crisis have been exposing all along that the united states is working directly with isis on the ground and that its sdf forces are doing so as well
the russian mod has released photos allegedly depicting us forces and isis working alongside one another against russian and syrian forces in deir ezzour
the photos which were released on twitter depict the sdf and american special forces working together in isiscontrolled territory what is notable is that neither forces have faced resistance from isis nor have they come under attack by the terror organization in addition neither the sdf nor the us forces appeared to have maintained defensive positions perimeters or patrols indicating that they are quite confident that the jihadists in the surrounding areas will not attack them the latter aspect seems to lend credence to the idea that both forces are working with isis not simply having entered into a truce with them since a truce would still necessitate the construction of a defensive perimeter they are in effect moving amongst one another as allies tend to do
along with the photos the russian ministry of defense released a statement which read
us special operations forces sof units enable usbacked syrian democratic forces sdf units to smoothly advance through the isis formations facing no resistance of the isis militants the sdf units are advancing along the left shore of the euphrates towards deir_ez_zor the aerial photos made on september 812 over the isis locations recorded a large number of american hummer vehicles which are in service with the americas sof the shots clearly show the us sof units located at strongholds that had been equipped by the isis terrorists though there is no evidence of assault struggle or any usled coalition airstrikes to drive out the militants despite that the us strongholds being located in the isis areas no screening patrol has been organized at them this suggests that theus_troops feel safe in terrorist controlled regions
previously russian defense ministry spokesman igor konashenkov stated that sdf militants work to the same objectives as daesh terrorists russian drones and intelligence have not recorded any confrontations between daesh and the third force sdf
with this in mind although some headway has been made in syria with the trump administration seeming to back off on the goal of total destruction of both the country and the government in favor of breaking syria up into several petty states it is clear that the agenda is still moving forward despite campaign rhetoric the trump administration is merely committing to the obama administrations plan b both however involved collusion with isis since it was the united states nato and the gcc that created funded organized and directed the terrorist organization to begin with with russia apparently realizing that the trump administration is simply continuing the insanity initiated under obama it seems russia is more willing to release information documenting the american support for terrorism in syria
in the end the russian photos serve to confirm what many researchers and independent journalists have known and written about for some time that the united states is not launching a war against isis it is directing it and working alongside isis in an attempt to weaken and destroy the secular syrian government

"__label__real new delhi thomson reuters foundation the united nations on friday defended its new global estimates on slavery after local media reported that indias intelligence agency advised prime minister narendra modi to discredit the research saying it may tarnish the countrys image and exports
a report by international labour organization ilo the international organization for migration iom and australian rights group walk free foundation published on sept 19 found more than 40 million people across the world were victims of modern day slavery last year
the report said 62 percent of those in forced marriages or forced labor such as construction or domestic work were in the asiapacific region it did not provide countryspecific data
but in a memo from indias intelligence bureau to modis office the agency questioned the reports methodology claiming the data has enough potential to substantially harm indias image and exports the indian express reported on wednesday
the bureau warned that global documentation on slavery is increasingly targeting india as home to the highest number of slaves in the world and called for a strong campaign to discredit the information the newspaper report added
a home ministry official said that he could not confirm or deny inputs from security agencies
ilo officials rejected claims india was being targeted and said they had full confidence in the reports findings
the memo is based on a misunderstanding there are no national figures in the data we dont single out any country beate andrees ilos chief of the fundamental principles and rights at work told the thomson reuters foundation
we collaborated with walk free for a global figure as there was there was a strong demand among practitioners who found it unhelpful to have competing numbers on this
questionable statistics
according to the indian express the memo cited figures from a 2016 report by the walk free foundation which estimated that 40 percent over 18 million of the worlds estimated 458 million slaves were in india
the ilos senior statistician michaelle de cock said the security agency had confused data from last years walk free foundation with this years new global estimates
there has been some confusion over the data we do not endorse the data from the walk free report last year our global estimates are based on a completely new methodology which has to go through all the usual ilo procedures
there are no national figures on the number of people in slavery in india but the labor ministry recently announced plans to identify rescue and help over 18 million bonded laborers by 2030
in india many victims are villagers lured by traffickers with the promise of a good job and an advance payment only to find themselves forced to toil in fields or brick kilns enslaved in brothels or confined as maids to pay off debt
others work at the bottom of complex and often untransparent supply chains producing everything from jewelry cosmetics and garments where they work long hours under strenuous condition for a meager wage and with little freedoms
according to the newspaper report the intelligence agency said the data from the ilowalk free foundation report was based on questionable statistics with interviews with over 17000 people in india but only 2000 or less in other countries
but walk free foundations head of global research fiona david said the global estimates were drawn from the best data available on modern slavery today
we welcome the indian governments continued focus and commitment on this issue said david we would be delighted to work with the indian government on national estimation efforts
campaigners say the leaked memo may be part of a wider policy by the indian government to crack down on civil society groups which voice dissent or attempt to show india in a poor light
in 2014 the security agency questioned the motives of foreignfunded charities such as greenpeace claiming that their campaigns against mining genetically modified crops and nuclear power was harming indias development

"__label__real image copyright afp image caption ahmed timols nephew imtiaz cajee testified to the pain of losing his uncle
the inquest into the 1971 death of antiapartheid activist ahmed timol has found that he was murdered shattering a fivedecadelong claim by security police that he had committed suicide
in a packed courtroom judge billy mothle ruled that he was pushed out of the window of the 10th floor building where he had been detained by the apartheid police
applause rang out in court at the end of his ruling vindication for the timol family at last
but what is the significant of the ruling for south africa and other families who have lost loved ones in a similar way
after this ruling we are hoping to see large scale investigations says lawson naidoo head of the council for the advancement of the south african constitution
many of those who were with mr timol at the time have since died but the judge found that they were complicit in his death and recommended that prosecutions should follow because perjury had been committed by some former state security members who testified at this hearing
and so for the first time in the history of its atrocities it seemed as though the apartheid system of white minority rule was on trial in south africa
reliving the past
the inquiry offered a rare glimpse into the gruesome workings of the racist regime and demanded answers
for those brief few weeks it was as though mr timol was speaking for himself and on behalf of those who died like him
media playback is unsupported on your device media caption what was apartheid a 90second look back at decades of injustice
officially police records say he leapt to his death from the infamous john vorster square now called johannesburg central police station
mr timols family had for years campaigned for a new investigation saying he was not one to give up that he would have never taken his own life
many other families here have for decades struggled to make peace with the deaths of their loved ones largely due to the secrecy around it
activists say that between 1963 and 1990 at least 73 antiapartheid fighters people died in police detention in some situation their deaths bore an uncanny resemblance to that of mr timol
still noone was ever called to account the murderers were faceless protected by the state even after the advent of democracy in 1994
for the mabelane family this case has inspired hope matthews then aged 23 was said to have jumped to his death like mr timol
image copyright afp image caption lasch mabelane and his father 95yearold phillip hope more investigations will follow
his older brother lasch mabelane tells me the family has for decades been haunted by not knowing what really happened to matthews
the day before he died the police came to my parents home and told them they need to make an appointment if they want to see him they said do you know you have a naughty child and said they would discipline him he says
many people like my brother supposedly jumped from the 10th floor its the same story the same floor he adds
other activists who died at john vorster square police station
wellington tshazibane found hanging in his cell on 11 december 1976
neil aggett found hanging in his cell on 5 february 1982
ernest dipale found hanging in his cell three days after his second detention died 5 august 1982
stanza bopape died of a heart attack after being subject to repeated electric shocks on 5 june 1988
clayton sithole found hanging dead in his cell on 30 january 1990
weve never believed that he killed himself he loved life and loved his family the pain of losing him changed all of us especially my parents
his father phillip mabelane is 95 years old and a widower he believes his wife died of a broken heart
our child died in a painful way we were left with so many questions and couldnt even ask them this trouble my wife until the end he says
the apartheid police were known to be violent you didnt ask questions you just accepted what you were told how can you ever find peace in a situation like that he asks
taking secrets to the grave
peace and stability in this country were paid for in blood and an unspoken vow by those who worked for the state to take secrets to the grave
this countrys vast landscape is dotted with the unmarked graves of apartheid activists dinner table conversations frequently drift into stories of exiles who disappeared without a trace leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions
image copyright afp image caption john vorster square now known as the johannesburg central police station was the sight of several assaults and deaths
the timol inquest could forever change that legacy
this was the first inquest in democratic south africa to specifically look into apartheid deaths in police custody
while an investigation into mr timols death was conducted at the time many had believed it was a coverup for the abuses that were happening at the height of white minority rule
the longawaited proceedings took weeks to conclude but had many glued to tv screens as highranking security police officers men who until now had lived in the shadows testified about the torture of activists at the height of the fight for freedom here
their actions included severe beatings electrocution and at times crushing testicles
in august fresh eyes began looking at the evidence led in court
some of the expert witnesses testified that some of mr timols injuries his cracked skull were not consistent with the conclusion the apartheid police had reached at the initial inquest back in 1971
files with evidence of his bludgeoned body told tales of assault witnesses testified to seeing mr timol days before his death being escorted by the police in the corridors of the police station and that he could barely walk
these records are some of what led to judge mothles historic findings
image copyright afp image caption many protests have been staged calling for an investigation into steve bikos death
mr timol isnt the only activist to die under suspicious circumstances steve biko also died while in police detention supposedly because he had been on a hunger strike no explanation was ever given for the bruises on his body
in the minds of many mr biko was murdered
nkosinathi biko through the steve biko foundation says their research puts the deaths of highprofile detainees including his father at 160
many of them have as a cause of death suicide or slipped on a bar of soap that sort of thing so uncovering the truth is important not only for those families but for the country it should be a national record he told the bbc
there have been attempts at unearthing the truth in democratic south africa such as the truth and reconciliation commission trc
however in recent years the trcs failure to compel apartheid loyalists who testified at the commission to tell all has come in for increasing criticism along with granting perpetrators amnesty for their testimony
while the hearings were hailed as a necessary process to help move the country into a peaceful democracy many said it denied justice to victims of apartheid
in the minds of many justice will only come if those behind the murders and torture are prosecuted and punished for their crimes
you cannot forgive what you do not know what was never acknowledged the people who killed our children must be made to tell the truth and face the consequences of their actions says mr mabelane snr"
__label__fake warning something big is about to happen in america the martial law is coming 100 chance it will happen red list and blue list
"__label__real in 2012 kansas lawmakers led by gov sam brownback a republican enacted a tax cut that eliminated state income taxes entirely for passthrough entities such as sole proprietorships and limited liability partnerships which are taxed at the owners individual income tax rate the law also lowered individual income tax rates cutting the top rate to 49 percent from 64 percent
the tax package reduced state revenue by nearly 700 million a year a drop of about 8 percent from 2013 through 2016 according to the kansas legislative research department forcing officials to shorten school calendars delay highway repairs and reduce aid to the poor research suggests the package did not stimulate the economy certainly not enough to pay for the tax cut this year legislators passed a bill to largely rescind the law saying it had not worked as intended
it caused a lot of budget instability said state senator jim denning a republican who led the effort to repeal the passthrough exemption this year mr denning who earns passthrough income from his interest in a commercial real estate firm said he had personally benefited from the exemption but the states economy had not
the passthrough exemption was responsible for 200 million to 300 million of that annual shortfall according to budget researchers at the tax foundation in washington between 2012 and 2015 the total number of kansans claiming passthrough income grew 20 percent to about 393000 from about 330000 a team of researchers from the university of south carolina and other institutions who studied the impact of the tax change found the top 2 percent of kansas earners reaped the largest gains from shifting income to passthroughs
participation at the federal level could be far more dramatic with tax benefits dwarfing those enjoyed in kansas the top income tax rate in kansas before the 2012 law was 64 percent this year it will be 52 percent growing to 57 percent in 2018 the top federal rate is 396 percent offering a significantly bigger incentive for tax avoidance if passthroughs are taxed at 25 percent already 70 percent of passthrough income flows to the top 1 percent of american income earners owen zidar an economist at the university of chicago booth school of business has found
republicans are considering lowering the top individual tax rate to 35 percent but mr trump has said he would maintain a higher rate on top earners in an effort to keep the income tax structure as progressive as it is now
photo
the experience of kansas shows that lawmakers should be cautious about taxing income from passthrough businesses at different rates than wages and salaries said scott greenberg a senior analyst at the nonpartisan tax foundation in washington which models tax proposals likely effects on the economy a passthrough cut he added would probably produce less growth than many other less expensive tax policy changes

republicans say they will erect guardrails to prevent workers from reclassifying themselves as contractors to exploit the lower rate but their plan does not provide specifics and tax experts say it will be difficult to restrict highincome individuals from diverting income through a passthrough
passthroughs have long been favored by small businesses such as dental offices and family farms but their use has expanded to include many financial and real estate firms mr trumps business empire is largely run through hundreds of passthrough companies the structure is also popular among consultants and other highearning independent contractors former president bill clinton for example receives payment for speeches through a passthrough entity

using a random sample of state tax returns jason debacker of the university of south carolina darla moore school of business bradley heim and justin m ross of indiana university and shanthi ramnath of the treasury department isolated the number of workers in kansas who routed income through passthrough entities after the law passed even though they continued to earn that income from the same source they found more than 2200 kansans had done so about 02 percent of workers in the state
if the rest of the country saw the same reclassification trend as kansas mr debacker said nearly 250000 americans would use the technique to lower their tax bills he cautioned that the number could be larger because the gap between the top tax rates on labor income and passthrough income would be substantially wider than it was in kansas and because tax professionals would have greater incentive to specialize in helping wage earners form passthroughs
im not going to go through the hassle of reclassifying myself just to save 10 said joseph rosenberg a senior research associate at the tax policy center in washington im only going to do it if theres a payoff and the 10 percentage points would make a difference for me
mr rosenberg and two colleagues estimate that such shifts could reduce federal revenues by at least 41 billion a year most of that 39 billion would come from existing passthrough owners paying lower taxes the rest would come from wealthy individuals routing income through passthroughs to minimize taxes
defenders of the kansas experiment say that the passthrough cut led to more new businesses forming while modestly raising growth at a time when the states key industries aerospace agriculture and energy production were faltering
they say that the states budget woes came from lawmakers unwillingness to impose spending cuts alongside the tax cuts and that it was never realistic to expect the tax cuts to produce enough growth to pay for themselves
those are effusive political hopes thats not economic analysis said dave trabert the president of the kansas policy institute a freemarket think tank its pretty common for people to hope that something is going to have a tremendous i think governor brownbacks phrase was shot of adrenaline thats not how economies work

mr beaty the kansas football coach was able to shield at least 575000 a year from income taxation by routing that money through his limited liability company according to state records that amount grew to 1375 million a year in a contract extension mr beaty signed in december 2016 next year as a result of the recent change in state law mr beaty will face a tax liability of nearly 80000 on his passthrough income
officials in the kansas athletics department referred questions about whether tax considerations factored into mr beatys contract structure to mr beatys agent kyle strongin who declined to comment
some other prominent coaches in the state including the kansas mens basketball coach bill self have long received some of their salaries through passthrough entities other coaches do not including the wichita state university mens basketball coach gregg marshall who earns 3 million a year entirely as labor income"

american car registration plates have become aluminium works of art and collecting them has never been more popular
on a quiet street in arlington virginia one man has squeezed the whole world into his garage
on one wall all 50 states of america next to it all 13 of canadas provinces and territories
most of mexico is above the garage door while another wall zips from continent to continent montenegro one minute micronesia the next
andrew pang has spent 40 years collecting plates and every sheet of metal tells a story
andrew has between 7000 and 8000 plates he received his first aged seven while growing up in virginia
my friend and neighbour across the street was from louisiana and he would go back every summer says andrew
one summer i said bring me something back from louisiana he chose to bring me a licence plate from his grandfathers car dealership
andrew had dabbled in stamp collecting and had developed an interest in other countries geography maps
when louisiana landed in his lap he decided to start collecting i thought everyone collects stamps he says this was a little different
in the us licence plates are issued by states territories
when plates expire they can be bought and sold by collectors
some states issue hundreds of types of plates usually to raise money or awareness for good causes
by the time andrew was 12 he had a plate from all 50 states his next challenge was collecting a virginia plate from every year they were issued
virginia has issued plates since 1906
it took me 25 years to complete says andrew
he found the missing piece of the jigsaw when a woman in fredericksburg virginia sold her deceased husbands collection he bought a dozen plates including the 1906 for around 4000
after completing the virginia set or run to use the terminology andrew looked for new worlds to conquer or new states at least
he spent four years in texas and completed its run he now wants the set from all 50 states plus the district of columbia but admits it will take time
im very close on dc maryland north dakota he says but i particularly focus on quality the plates condition i could have finished many runs if i took anything
image copyright getty images image caption many states and territories use their plates to advertise their attractions
when andrew started collecting plates the hobby was an oddity he says but two things have changed that the internet and the trend for colourful welldesigned plates
many of the plates in the old days were very very boring he says at the time their only reason was for identification two colours no pictures no designs
with a few notable exceptions the first real foray into more interesting graphics was 1976 for the us bicentennial the 200th anniversary of the declaration of independence
at that time quite a few states offered very specific bicentennial plates to everyone
the next marker says andrew was in 1986 after the challenger space shuttle disaster florida issued a plate with a rocket design to raise funds for the astronauts memorial foundation
states began to realise the potential of plates and the era of brighter distinctive designs began oregons plates have a fir tree for example north dakotas have a bison floridas have two oranges
the effect when driving on american roads is twofold on one hand the country seems vast its not uncommon in dc to see plates from california 3000 miles away for example
on the other it makes the country seem smaller more interesting and more united oh look there goes someone from maine or michigan or montana were all americans here
image copyright andrew pang image caption plates design began to change in the 1970s as seen in these examples from 1970 and 1996
there is of course another reason for the rise in welldesigned plates
the american population is very mobile says andrew a 47yearold accountant this summer we drove 6000 miles across the country and thats not unusual
the states realised heres my person from virginia people are going to see his licence plate lets do something
if youre in florida youre nowhere near a mountain but you see a car from colorado and they have the snowcovered peaks on the plate
south carolina pennsylvania and many others put their tourism website on their licence plate in many ways they have replaced the bumper sticker its free advertising
massachusetts issued the first licence plate in the us in 1903
american plates have been made from materials including porcelain copper and fibreboard
among the rarest plates are 1913 mississippi and 1921 alaska when they change hands its in the low five figures says andrew
the automobile license plate collectors association began in 1954 it has almost 3000 members from all 50 states and 19 countries
around 500 people attend its annual conventions and there are smaller regional meetings too jeff minard became a member in the 1960s aged 15
your member number is related to when you joined says jeff my number is 495 there are very few threedigit members alive
jeff says licence plate collecting has become enormous although he distinguishes between serious collectors such as the associations members and those who may have a dozen or so in their garage
im not dismissing them at all the less serious collectors he says but were a little more academic if i can put it like that
one collector in florida has 50000 license plates unbelievable says jeff
jeff himself has 500 after downsizing his collection from 5000 i sold a lot he says im finding homes for them i dont want someone else to have to do that
we just hope they dont get recycled for aluminium
image caption part of andrews international collection including the monaco plate 0000
back in arlington andrew pang looks at the international plates on his garage wall in between albania and the bahamas is a 1998 plate from monaco still in a plastic wrapper
i wrote to the prince asking for a plate he says i didnt expect anything to happen but it arrived in the post a few weeks later
most of andrews plates however are bought online rather than from royalty
he has plates from former countries such as east germany disputed territories such as south ossetia in eastern europe and moments in history such as when iraq occupied kuwait
he even has a plate from the pacific island of vanuatu it is made from wood
andrew is missing plates from around 40 countries and territories the pitcairn islands a tiny british territory in the south pacific are proving tricky while the vatican city is tightly controlled
could you buy one if money wasnt an issue
probably but youre talking high hundreds of dollars maybe low thousands he says
image caption andrew has plates from most countries
despite having walls covered in plates does andrew still glance at every back bumper he passes
i am afflicted with that he admits
just yesterday i saw a vehicle in a parking lot from puerto rico and thats quite unusual in this area near dc i look for diplomatic plates
what really excites me is if i see a us diplomat thats coming back from another country but theyre back such a short period of time the plates from the other country are still on the vehicle
and what does his wife make of it all
my wife is less of a hobbyist than i am says andrew smiling
while she has grown to understand it and live with it she doesnt necessarily embrace it"
"__label__fake passing game film review mcfrown week 3 dolphins
before its news
welcome to the second part of our film breakdown as we look at the bad plays from this past game the jets won and the offense performed relatively well so this article is short as mentioned in the comments discussing the previous thread this series is going to be shorter on words from here on out lets look at the issues on offense this past week
1
this is a sack early in the game where mccown fails to step up in the pocket instead choosing to evade towards the sideline and ultimately getting sacked there are receivers open down the field and an emergency option in the running back coming out of the backfield the qb should have stepped up in the pocket on this play
2
this is a completed pass but nevertheless a bad pass austinseferian jenkins makes a really good play on the ball for the catch otherwise its going towards the defender the play call has a tiered option as well and mccown makes the right choice but he has to throw a better pass than this to be consistently successful
3
the play most likely should have ended up with a penalty on either the offensive or defensive player the pass is underthrown and this is borderline placement in the bad throws department anderson gets pushed off the route which slows him down and the ball ends up slightly under thrown if anderson wasnt interfered with he would have ran just a bit further down the field which would make this pass severely under thrown very good play call otherwise as there are multiple options around the field
4
josh mccown makes a good read but a horrible pass the play set up on this pass is great as the qb reads the reaction of the linebacker if the linebacker stays with the tight end the ball is thrown in the flat to the running back if the linebacker breaks through to go towards the running back as he does on this play then hit the tight end for an easy pass everything works except for the throw
5
mccown misses a wide open crossing route to start this play and then does a good job of eluding defenders in the pocket and finding free space the running back does a great job of running down the field instead of blocking leaving him wide open for a pass all mccown has to do is pass it to the wide open running back and this is a major completion but the quarterback doesnt take the pass instead he gets hit hard by the defender and goes down
6
the jets get aggressive here and go for a td but mccown throws this pass right into double coverage he doesnt see the linebacker dropping back from the middle to take away the route and the jets are lucky this pass falls down for an incomplete pass
conclusion
the jets offense looked markedly better than at any point this year during the dolphins game it wasnt a game without faults but they did a good job of limiting their mistakes and taking advantage of the defense which seemed to play timid all game long

there is nothing inevitable about such vast fastrising incomewealth inequality it is the only possible output of our financial and paytoplay political system
one chart defines the 21st century economy and thus its sociopolitical system the chart of soaring wealthincome inequality this chart doesnt show a modest widening in the gap between the superwealthy top 110th of 1 and everyone else there is a veritable grand canyon between the superwealthy and everyone else a gap that is recent in origin
notice that the majority of all income growth now accrues to the the very apex of the wealthpower pyramid this is not mere chance it is the only possible output of our financial system this is stunning indictment of our sociopolitical system for this sort of fastincreasing concentration of income wealth and power in the hands of the very few at the top can only occur in a financialpolitical system which is optimized to concentrate income wealth and power at the top of the apex
wellmeaning conventional economists have identified a number of structural causes of rising wealthincome inequality dynamics that ive often discussed here over the past decade
global wage arbitrage resulting from the commodification of labor aka globalization a winnertakesmost power law distribution of the gains reaped from new technologies and markets a widening mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the needs of a rapidly changing economy the concentration of capital gains in assets such as highend real estate stocks and bonds that are owned almost exclusively by the top 10 of households the longterm stagnation productivity the secular decline in the percentage of the economy that flows to wages and salaries
while each of these is real the elephant in the room few are willing to mention much less discuss is financialization the siphoning off of most of the economys gains by those few with the power to borrow and leverage vast sums of capital to buy income streamsa dynamic that greatly enriches the rentier class which has unique access to central bank and privatesector bank credit and leverage
apologists seek to explain away this soaring concentration of wealth as the inevitable result of some secular trend that were powerless to rein in as if the process that drives this concentration of wealth and power wasnt political and financial
there is nothing inevitable about such vast fastrising incomewealth inequality it is the only possible output of our financial and paytoplay political system
policy tweaks such as tax reform are mere public relations ploys the cancer eating away at our economy and society arises from the federal reserve and the structure of our financial system and the the degradation of our representative democracy into a paytoplay auction to the highest bidder

"__label__real brasilia reuters brazils scandalplagued political class voted on wednesday to set up a 17 billion reais 542 million fund with taxpayer money to finance election campaigns making up for a dearth of private funding ahead of next years general election
a ban on corporate donations coupled with the drying up of underthetable contributions and kickbacks in the wake of the countrys biggest corruption scandal have left lawmakers struggling to raise campaign funding
the lower house of congress approved a bill that had passed the senate and will take funds from pork barrel appropriations and government payments to buy tv and radio time for parties
the fund was meant to be part of improvements to brazils discredited political system to reduce a proliferation of parties that has made it hard to govern latin americas largest nation without unwieldy coalitions based on selfinterest
the senate unanimously approved on tuesday a constitutional amendment that limits coalitions to parties with similar platforms but it will not go into effect until the 2022 elections
more than 100 lawmakers are targeted by the car wash corruption investigation that uncovered a network of bribes from private companies seeking to win contracts or influence policies and even implicated president michel temer and several of his cabinet ministers
critics of the campaign fund said it was aimed at providing funding for lawmakers seeking reelection to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption
it is shameful that this fund will be used by unethical politicians who should not be sitting here in congress said julio delgado leader of the brazilian socialist party psb not a single lawmaker under investigation has opposed it
backers of the use of public money for campaigns argued that organized crime would step in to finance politicians if funding was lacking
the sprawling car wash graft investigation that convicted dozens of executives from brazils main contractor companies has shut down the flow of undeclared payments to politicians
what most worries them is where they will get money for their campaigns now that companies cannot donate and are not willing to engage in illegal contributions said lucas de aragão partner at political risk consultancy arko advice
on the positive side he said congress set a threshold for parties to be able to access public funding and free tv time based on the votes they win which will help reduce the number of parties today totaling 35
this version of the story corrects the fifth paragraph to say coalitions reform will not go into effect until the 2022 elections

"__label__fake the ditch list week 4 fallout breaking down four players it may be time to cut bait on
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
not every cut is created equal and its going to depend on your league sizeformat in many cases that said there have been some obviously disappointing starts to the season and in the right circumstance three weeks is enough information to formulate a decision cut bait and move on lets take a look at a few candidates that you should consider dropping
amari cooper oakland raiders wide receiver
cooper had a difficult matchup against the broncos but his 2 reception 8 yard performance is just the latest in what has been a disappointing season overall hes turned 23 targets into 10 catches and 101 yards sure hes scored a td but that came in week 1 and hes been virtually unusable over the past three weeks
vs new york jets 4 receptions for 33 yards
at washington 1 reception for 6 yards
at denver 2 receptions for 9 yards
with derek carr leaving yesterdays game early only adds another little twist as he could potentially be looking at ej manuel starting in the shortterm though well have to wait and see completely giving up on cooper doesnt make sense as theres simply too much upside potential but at this point hes obviously a player who belongs on your bench and nowhere else
verdict firmly plant on your bench but dont give up
paul perkins new york giants running back
he wasnt doing much early in the game 9 carries for 13 yards and then went down with an injury in his place stepped wayne gallman who looked better than perkins has all season long as he turned 11 carries into 42 yards while catching 2 passes for 8 yards and 1 td well have to wait and see how long perkins is sidelined but even if he doesnt miss time youd have to think that the giants will give gallman an opportunity perkins is averaging 21 yards per carry and has not rushed for more than 22 yards in a game with his dismal production his role in question and the potential injury perkins is a disposal player at this point
verdict droppable in 12formats if you need roster spot
eric decker tennessee titans wide receiver
marcus mariota was injured which would further hurt the upside of decker who has been a relative bust despite being one of the significant acquisitions for the team yesterday decker was targeted just twice putting up 2 receptions for 13 yards hes totaled 12 receptions for 104 yards and his season best is 4 receptions week 3 and 49 yards week 3 hes been targeted a total of 20 times though not more than 5 since week 1 he had 8 targets in the first week he also has failed to find the end zone as tennessee is a run based offense and decker appears to be the third receiving option at best
rishard matthews 32 targets
delanie walker 26 targets
eric decker 20 targets
at this point decker is droppable in shallower formats but worth stashing in deeper leagues if the waiver wire is fairly barren
verdict droppable in 12team leagues and shallower
breshad perriman baltimore ravens wide receiver
this is the third season for the former first round draft pick so expectations were high instead hes been a bust with 25 of the season behind him totaling 2 receptions for 11 yards just to make matters worse he has a total of 8 targets which came split between weeks 1 and 4 he went untargeted in weeks 2 and 3
perriman is going to be limited by the struggles of joe flacco and hes also going to be behind jeremy maclin and mike wallace on the depth chart in other words the outlook is fairly limited and theres little reason to think that anything is going to change
verdict droppable in 14team leagues and shallower

"__label__fake new federally funded work program has starbucks serving lattes to inmates
 
for those of us that like to drink starbucks we know those coffees at 6 bucks a pop can become costly by the end of the month this can cost a regular starbucks drinker over 150 a month just to indulge in those addictive drinks making it a treat only the working class can afford
 
but not anymore starbucks has received a grant opportunity from the united states department of labors ready to work program this will allow prisons to open up starbucks kiosks and production facilities in selected prisons across the united states serving americas prisoners free starbucks coffee
 
starbucks is not new to using prisoners for cheap production labor did you know that your prepackaged starbucks coffee is package by murderers thieves and other miscellaneous convicts starbucks subcontractor signature packaging solutions has been hiring washington prisoners to package coffees since the late 1990s when confronted by a reporter in 2001 a starbucks rep called the setup entirely consistent with our mission statement
 
starbucks spokesperson helen rochester says this is an opportunity every american deserves these prisoners will go through the same barista training as any other new starbucks employee said rochester we hope this program will help convicted felons who are making their way out of prison obtain employment required by their parole agreement we will be happy to welcome them to the starbucks family
 
many skeptics feel this is a risky move for the starbucks corporation however with a 75 million federally funded work program grant in place money is surely the focus
 
so while you are sipping on your overpriced 6 latte and scraping up your starbucks allowance for the week just know that prisoners now get to enjoy free frappuccinos and cable tv on your tax dollars you might also want to think again before you buy your prepackaged starbuck coffee grounds that are produced in the washington prisons i hear prisons arent the most sanitary of places

"__label__fake before its news
the ashes arguably international crickets most vicious rivalry rolls around once more in november although england emerged victorious 31 in the australian series of 201011 the series of 201314 saw australia enact vengeance in the most emphatic way possible a 50 whitewash given the squads home ashes record australia would always be favourites against england however the home side have never been so widely backed to score a second consecutive home whitewash over england
50 whitewash universally expected
to say that the two sides approach the series in contrasting mindsets would be an understatement and this is reflected in current ashes odds which can be viewed by anyone who opts to click here after losing 21 to south africa last autumn australia have bounced back in very real terms with perfect home test form prevalent after that disappointing showing against the springboks by contrast england will travel to australia in unusually low spirits with ben stokes recent exclusion on disciplinary grounds from the visiting squad only serving to divide and disrupt
englands away form can only give the australian squad even more encouragement with the squad losing 41 to india in its last away test series some experts would assert that englands only true hope is joe root with most of the other expected first xi performing erratically of late to the more ardent england fan alastair cook is considered something of a talisman but many believe that age is now catching up with him even at home england have been susceptible to the occasional batting collapse with the fourth test in the recent home series against the west indies being a very damning case in hand
smith can be captain fantastic
as one of the chosen few to be an ashes captain steve smith will naturally be in the spotlight more than any other home player though his captaincy has seen mixed fortunes for australia if all forms of international cricket are taken into account his personal statistics spell danger for england as of june 2017 smith had scored twelve centuries and averaged 7327 per inning overcoming a humiliation at the hands of south africa in 2016 was also a real test of character for smith with his captaincy then very much in the balance 2017 has been a truer reflection of his abilities and smith also has a test win rate of exactly 50 as australias captain
nsw trio to give england the blues
much of the confidence in the home side stems from the range of efficient fast bowlers that australia coach darren lehmann has at his disposal
pat cummins josh hazlewood and mitchell starc are the most prominent men in that respect with the latter two being lefthanded australia will have the luxury of a multidimensional approach to dismissing englands top batsmen the fact that the trio are teammates at the nsw blues can only add further fuel to the arguments in favour of an australian whitewash
david warner 30 not out
though now the wrong side of thirty top order batsman david warner has the experience and composure needed to fulfil the expectation of a whitewash though part of a side that completed a 41 odi series defeat to india just days ago it was warners neversaydie attitude which yielded the century that enabled the touring aussies to win and avoid a whitewash as one of the most hardhitting australian batsmen in recent memory those who simply crave entertainment will certainly be keeping one eye on warner
looking ahead
lehmanns uncompromising australia squad has the impetus but stranger things have happened in international cricket the 201718 ashes series begins at the gabba on 23 november

"__label__fake the european union hid surprising study on internet piracy
 
back 2013 the european commission ordered an expensive research study costing 360000 in taxpayers money regarding how piracy affects sales of music books movies and video games across the european union after a great deal of investigation the study found that there was no evidence that piracy had an impact on copyrighted sales except for newly released blockbusters and that piracy seemed to be driving the sales of video games this conclusion was not want the european commission wanted to hear as they refused to release the results of the study to the public
 
it is likely that the public would have never found the results of the study if it wasnt for the concerted efforts of the european union parliamentarian julia reda who has submitted a freedom of information request to make sure that the information is publicly available she records that while the european commission initially stalled in releasing the study twice that it is now publicly available after assessing the evidence reda wrote on her blog that with the exception of recently released blockbusters there is no evidence to support the idea that online copyright infringement displaces sales it has been suggested that newly released blockbusters are being singularly affected by the rise of internetbased piracy because of their higher price policy in comparison to the other forms of media covered in the study
 
since redas revelation it has transpired that the european union have been behaving in a deeply disingenuous manner with regards to the contents of this study two european union commissioners have been quick to highlight the discovery that internet piracy is driving down ticket sales at the cinema by around 44 to argue in favor of stricter copyright laws however when they referenced the study to support their argument they did not mention that the researchers found no robust statistical evidence of displacement of sales by online piracy with regards to games books or music
 
these revelations have affirmed suspicions among those who oppose the tightening of copyright laws that the european commission has been behaving disingenuously in the course of this debate this seems to substantiate suspicion that the european commission was hiding the study on purpose and cherrypicked the results they wanted to publish by choosing only the results which supported their political agenda towards stricter copyright rules edri wrote
 
following the release of the document into the public domain the european commission has also chosen to make it available to the public by their official channels however for those who oppose a tightening of the copyright laws this action is sure to be considered too little too late

"__label__fake north korea responds furiously to american show of military strength
 
the north korean government has responded furiously to a show of military force by the united states
 
us bombers were deployed to fly close to the east coast of north korea to demonstrate their full range of military options if north korea were to launch a preemptive on their allies on the united states itself this flight is the farthest north of any us bomber in the twentyfirst century
 
img srchttpfs5directuploadnetimages170923v74jpg22png
 
the pentagon has released a statement with regards to the flight claiming that it was a show of force intended to show the north koreans how seriously the united states was taking its reckless behavior with regards to its nuclear weapon programme this mission is a demonstration of us resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat read the statement we are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the us homeland and our allies
 
representatives from the north korean government have responded furiously to the united states military action with the foreign minister ri yongho saying that president donald trump was on a suicide mission earlier in the week president trump made an incendiary speech at the united nations where he said that the united states would destroy north korea if it was deemed to be necessary ri said that these insults by the president indicated that he was mentally deranged and full of megalomania and that if the military action were to continue then it would be an inevitability that north korea would be forced to fire missiles at the us mainland president trump responded to ris comments on twitter where he threatened that neither the foreign minister nor kim jongun would be around much longer if they were to continue with their rhetoric
 
the assembly of the united nations has been a tightening of sanctions against north korea because of its unauthorized nuclear weapons programme however the hermit kingdom has refused to give up its nuclear weapons despite the successive rounds of sanctions because it is believed to be their greatest defense against the outside world

"__label__fake 10 important stories from 092917 box scores storys turn around not buying c anderson more
before its news
by eric stashin aka the rotoprofessor
one start means nothing in the scheme of things but it was nice to see masahiro tanaka finish with a bang tossing 70 shutout innings allowing 3 h and 0 bb while striking out 15 it was another ace performance from stephen strasburg who tossed 72 shutout innings allowing 2 h and 2 bb striking out 8 to finish the year at 154 with a 252 era mike trout posted a big day going 23 with 2 hr 2 rbi and 2 r what else happened on the field that we need to know about lets take a look
1 greg bird continues to find his footing
he went 22 with 2 rbi extending his hitting streak to 7 games over the streak hes gone 1024 with 4 hr 11 rbi and 6 r even more impressive is his 4 k vs 2 bb over the stretch and while the end game numbers stink hes finally showing what he can do when hes healthy and finding his footing strikeouts are going to be key he entered the day with a career 280 strikeout rate and hell likely be more of a platoon player but he has the potential to hit 280 with 30 hr when things are right hes certainly not a player to ignore and this late season surge is showing us why
2 is it time to ignore gerrit coles upside
he was unimpressive in his final start allowing 3 er on 8 h and 1 bb striking out 7 over 51 ip and finished with an average line of 1212 with a 426 era and 125 whip the big issue is obviously home runs 31 hr over 2030 ip but we obviously cant ignore the skillset that he does bring to the table as he entered the day with an 861 k9 246 bb9 and 458 groundball rate prior to 17 he had never posted a hrfb greater than 94 he was under 7 each of the past two seasons but entered the day with a 161 mark he did avoid allowing a home run yesterday if he can get that number back in check hes going to be a top 25 starter so dont ignore him as a posthype sleeper heading into 18
3 matt harvey goes out with a whisper
to call harveys 2017 campaign anything more than a significant disappointment would be a mistake as he finished up with a 670 era and 169 whip over 922 ip taking on the phillies yesterday he allowed 4 er on 7 h and 3 bb striking out 3 over 40 ip as hes struggled mightily with both home runs 21 and walks 67 over his 922 ip we can dig into any numbers we want but they are irrelevant the question comes down to the injuries and whether or not he can get back to the pitcher he once was and thats a complete mystery at this point hes nothing more than a late round flier
4 alex bregman continues to show his value
he provided all of the offense for the astros yesterday going 34 with 1 hr 3 rbi and 1 r and after looking like a significant disappointment early on has completely turned his season around hes currently on a sevengame hitting streak and after hitting 256 with 8 hr and 8 sb in the first half hes now hitting 322 with 11 hr 44 rbi 48 r and 9 sb in the second half the big differences is that hes reduced his strikeout rate 170 to 136 entering the day and had better luck 291 babip to 333 with both numbers being highly realistic his second half numbers are for real and he easily could replicate them over an entire season
5 trevor bauer makes a big lead stand up
the indians jumped on the white sox early racking up 10 r so it was an easy day for trevor bauer who took it and shutdown chicago allowing 1 r on 4 h and 0 bb striking out 7 over 60 ip hes pitched well overall in the second half including allowing 2 er or less in seven of his final nine starts of course he still entered the day with a 131 whip in the second half as he carried an elevated babip 338 and benefited from an unsustainable 871 strand rate with a 225 line drive rate and 151 hrfb he allowed another home run yesterday its easy to call the second half more of a mirage and like his 17 wins not a reason to buy in
6 a strong finish for ozzie albies
he filled the box score last night going 35 with 1 hr 1 rbi 2 r and 1 sb obviously a fourgame hitting streak doesnt mean much in the scheme of things but it definitely shows his potential as hes gone 918 with 1 hr 3 rbi 2 r and 4 sb he has 5 sb over his past five games hes now hitting 288 in the majors though wed like to see a bit of an improvement in his plate discipline 106 swstr 335 oswing entering the day but that should come with experience hes maturing in his power and has the speed meaning he could take a significant step forward come 2018
7 trevor story bringing back memories of 16
its been a disappointing season overall for story though hes finishing strong moved to the cleanup spot yesterday he went 34 with 1 hr 2 rbi and 2 r and now has 2 hr 9 rbi and 5 r over his final three games hes still hitting just 239 on the season though he does have 24 hr and 7 sb we all know that the problem is his ability to make consistent contact entering the day with a 345 strikeout rate and 142 swstr hes going to provide some power and speed he could easily be a 3010 player but unless he cuts down on the strikeouts the average is going to be a liability
8 is whit merrifield for real
he went 24 with 1 hr 1 rbi and 1 r yesterday putting him at 289 with 19 hr 78 rbi 80 r and 33 sb on the season if you want to be picky you will point towards his 326 obp as a reason to knock him and thats definitely a fair point for a player hitting atop the batting order he could stand to improve upon his 47 walk rate but he does make consistent contact 78 swstr hits the ball hard 220 line drive rate and has the speed to further improve upon his babip 310 the question is going to be if he can maintain a 20 hr type pace but theres little question that hes a 280 hitter with the ability to go 1525 once again throw in the fact that theres really no reason to believe that he cant maintain this years explosion and hes going to be hard to knock
9 chase anderson finishes with a strong showing
taking on the cardinals he allowed 1 er on 3 h and 1 bb striking out 5 over 70 ip to finish the season at 124 with a 274 era and 109 whip over 1411 ip of course before we get too excited and consider him a top 30 starter heading into 2018 we have to keep in mind that there was significant luck behind the production 806 strand rate 265 babip and also could easily regress in the number of home runs allowed 392 groundball rate 089 hr9 and a less than favorable home ballpark anderson has overpay written all over him at this point and it will be interesting to see where he lands on ranking lists heading into 2018
10 another struggle for tyler skaggs
taking on the mariners he allowed 3 er on 6 h and 1 bb striking out 7 over 42 ip as a pair of home runs were the big blows thats been the story for him with 13 hr allowed over 850 ip though we also cant overlook his pedestrian 81 swstr and 296 oswing always battling injuries and with limited upside hes looking like a 425ish era pitcher and at this point thats simply not someone wed be looking to target

"__label__real seattle each night when the guns fell silent in iraq btoo allami would invite his friend nayyef hrebid over for dinner
the two first locked eyes on a dusty battlefield in ramadi after days of exchanging hasty glances amid gunfire they snuck away one night to listen to michael jackson on shared earbuds
the music stopped but a love story was just beginning
a decade ago allami was a sergeant in the iraqi military when he met hrebid then a translator for the us marines
militants had seized a hospital in ramadi and they were part of a mission to reclaim it
when not defusing bombs theyd talk late into the night at a pitch black lot surrounded by humvees allami fell in love unafraid of the war yet terrified by what was happening with hrebid
nayyef hrebid and btoo allami at their home in seattle on august 13 2017
their love story would take them through two continents as they joined the 22 million refugees in the world all fleeing war grinding poverty and in their case persecution from militants and relatives last year only 14700 iraqi refugees were resettled worldwide says andrej mahecic a spokesman for the un refugee agency the un does not have the number of applicants who claim asylum based on their sexual orientation or gender identity few countries if any collect such statistics he says
taking chances
lgbt people in iraq risk harassment beatings and brutal killings sometimes by family members isis which held large swaths of iraqi territory until recently has also targeted gay men tossing many to their deaths from tall buildings
despite the risks allami took a chance two weeks after they met i love you he told hrebid
hrebid did not say a word but drew him close and kissed him
allami was so excited he didnt eat for two days at the time he didnt know that hrebid loved his calm demeanor and the way his dark hair shone in the sunlight
their relationship grew but in secret they knew loving each other openly could be deadly even during the days of dont ask dont tell when the us did not officially allow gay people to serve in the military hrebid says a base officer allowed them to spend time together at the american base
their talks put them in a bubble during those moments war and bloodshed did not exist
one last night
hrebid loved his job as a translator
at the base his american buddies called him david to protect his identity but word got out that he was gay and that he was a us translator his name was added to a militant hit list posted on the streets of ramadi
when the two men were separated by continents hrebid would draw sketches of him and allami
people started talking it was time to leave
in march 2009 hrebid applied for asylum as part of a program that gives preference to iraqis and afghans who translated for the us government overseas hrebids application was approved eight months later
the night he got his us visa they sat up all night in a candlelit room hugging each other and crying
as much as it crushed him hrebid flew to seattle in december 2009 leaving allami behind
but they kept their promise to stay in touch one night as they chatted on skype allamis relatives overheard them and realized he was gay
some of his relatives accused him of bringing shame to the family and wanted him killed he says terrified allami deserted the military and stuffed a backpack with pants and a few tshirts hrebid paid for his ticket to flee to lebanon in november 2010
seven thousand miles away hrebid started his new life in seattle the only place he knew someone in the us
but while he was finally safe hed lie awake worrying what if allami was detained for overstaying his 30day tourist visa and deported back to iraq a return home now included the risk of arrest by the military for desertion
a recent documentary out of iraq tells their love story and has won two emmys
one day while at a party hrebid met activist michael failla and told him about his relationship with allami his new friend would become their lifeline
living in the shadows
allamis new life in beirut did not involve parties and new friendships he lived in the shadows and worked illegally as a shoe salesman for 250 a month hrebid sent him money to help with upkeep as he desperately sought a way to get him to seattle
with every day spent away from hrebid allami sank further into depression hed sit in bed at night and guzzle bottles of beer
hrebid blamed himself as allami languished in a new country despite the time difference they did their best to maintain a normal relationship they would skype and virtually eat together breakfast for one and dinner for the other
we would cook together and discuss things almost like we lived together hrebid recalls
they also showered each other with sentimental gifts including locks of each others hair
hrebid would sit in bed smell allamis hair and cry other days hed send allami long letters describing his undying love
my heart melts at the sound of your voice one letter says when i look at you i see clear skies
in december 2010 desperate to join hrebid allami filed for asylum from the united nations refugee agency not knowing it would take years
hrebid and allami look over letters they wrote to each other when they were separated
the united nations refugee agency interviewed allami eight times but his application was bogged down by translation errors according to failla who attended several interviews with him
one error in particular complicated his case during one asylum interview he was asked whether as a soldier he was familiar with the abu ghraib prison torture he said he watched it on tv but it was translated that he witnessed it firsthand implying he was complicit failla says
in the process of seeking asylum applicants can have a preference for country of resettlement but countries decide whether to accept an applicant
allamis preference was the us but the agonizing wait for a decision was so long he applied for a separate visa to canada at its embassy in beirut
in march 2013 nearly three years after he escaped from iraq canada said yes
allami arrived in vancouver in may of the same year he was now 150 miles away from hrebid and their dream of living together suddenly seemed within reach
hrebid would drive to vancouver every weekend to see him on valentines day 2014 they got married at a courthouse in vancouver with failla as a witness
we always say michael was our angel the world needs more angels like michael hrebid says
wedding photos decorate a wall in their living room
washington state recognized samesex marriages at the time and hrebid quickly applied for a visa for his new husband at the us consulate in montreal
when the consular official approved it allami sat down on the embassy floor and wept hrebid covered his mouth and screamed
i was shaking so hard allami says i asked the embassy person to repeat again just to be sure
a new chapter
the date march 6 2015 will forever be etched in allamis mind he finally moved to seattle to be with hrebid
a few months later on august 8 of the same year they had their dream wedding at faillas house surrounded by friends
allami left and hrebid on their wedding day in seattle
allami then applied for permanent residency known as a greencard as hrebids husband the couple relishes their life in seattle where they live with their siberian husky cesar and cat lodus a rainbow flag draped over the balcony of their new town home flutters in the wind
inside their home black and white photos of their wedding day line the walls in other photos they are hiking through the mountains or simply gazing into each others eyes

on tuesday the world watched as apple unveiled their tenthanniversary special edition iphone the iphone x while iphone boasts a newer more secure phoneusing its patented new facial recognition systeminternet sleuths were quick to point out the ominous implications behind the new tech
as rt reports the iphone x replaces the iconic home button featured on all previous versions with a new truedepth camera system a little black bar at the top of the phone contains several sensors cameras and even a dot projector that all work together to create a mathematical 3d model of the owners face
however there are some ways this technology can actually be used against you
imagine for a moment you are one of the countless individuals who just filmed a gruesome act of police brutality many of those countless individuals as tftp has frequently reported have found themselves subject to unlawful detainment and illegal search and seizure as cops attempt to erase any evidence of their wrongdoing now imagine that the only thing standing in the way of a coverup of an innocent person being killed by police is the password on your phone to protect the video from police deleting it
a secure phone at this moment is the only thing that can protect the documented evidence of criminal behavior luckilyfor the policeif you have a new iphone x all they theoretically need to do is to handcuff you and point it at your face now they have access to all of your private information
think police wont try to delete your video think again
just last week in an exclusive report tftp exposed a case of alleged deleted evidence in lincoln parish louisiana after a police officer killed a deaf electrical engineer a security guard said he watched and filmed police kill josh cloudan account which differs greatly from the official storyand he was detained and his video deleted
had his phone been locked and had the security guard resisted alleged police pressure to confiscate his phone evidence of a police murder may still exist however if he had an iphone x even if he wouldve resisted they need only point it at his face
with the iphone x your iphone is locked until you look at it and it recognizes you nothing has ever been more simple natural and effortless phil schiller apples senior vice president of worldwide marketing said in his keynote speech tuesday this is the future of how well unlock our smartphones and protect our sensitive information
however as many have pointed out this simplicity is the devices potential downfall
faceid
good design looks surprisingly robust already has a panic disable
bad normalizes facial scanning a tech certain to be abused edward snowden snowden september 12 2017
this abuse as snowden points out can come in many forms
with faceid cops can just point your phone at your face while they have you in handcuffs then look through your phone without a warrant jerrah mormont bostonjerry september 12 2017 the firearms survival guide ad
while some folks expressed concern that the iphone x will allow someone to unlock your iphone while you sleep apple directly countered that claim noting that the feature will only work when the user looks at the device with their eyes open schiller also explained that faceid will recognize a user even when they change their hairstyle put on glasses wear a hat or change their appearance in other waysperhaps when an unconscious person has their eyes pulled open
the good news however is that while this technology has these ominous implications for abuse it is far more secure than any of the previous devices according to schiller the touch id had a false unlock rate of one in 50000 whereas the new faceid only had an error rate of one in 1 million
apple also has an extensive history of resisting the police state attempts at creating back doors to their technology just last year in a landmark case apple refused to help the government break the law and allow for the various spy agencies to monitor iphone users with a special decryption key for the state
had the government successfully forced apple into unlocking the phone or creating a backdoor to their encryption experts in the technology field warned that this could be the end of privacy as we know it for now however privacy is still winningthat is until we see the first case of police unlocking an iphone x by pointing at a handcuffed persons face
