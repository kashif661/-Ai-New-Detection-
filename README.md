# Fake News Detection Algorithm

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a Fake News Detection Algorithm using FastText, a popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) library. The algorithm is designed to classify news articles as either real or fake based on previous data and a trained machine learning model.

## Features

- **Fake News Detection**: The algorithm is capable of analyzing news articles and determining their authenticity by classifying them as real or fake.

- **FastText**: We've utilized the FastText library to train and test our machine learning model. FastText is known for its speed and efficiency in NLP tasks.

- **Customizable**: The project is highly customizable, allowing you to adapt the algorithm to different datasets and languages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- FastText (Install using `pip install fasttext`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and FastText.
3. Preprocess your data, ensuring it's in a suitable format for training (for example, having labeled real and fake news articles).
4. Train the model using your data.
5. Use the trained model to classify news articles as real or fake.

```bash
python train.py --data train_data.txt --model fake_news_model
python classify.py --model fake_news_model --news_article article.txt
